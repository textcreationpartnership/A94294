            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T the beginning of theſe troubles, I publiſhed a ſhort Diſcourſe, of <hi>the Primitive government of Churches;</hi> and after it a larger, of <hi>the Apoſtolicall form of Divine Service, at the Aſſemblies of the Church:</hi> Thinking it eaſie to inferre what ought to be done, if it could be made to appear what the Apoſtles had done. Since that time, Congregations have been erected, and Presbyteries Ordained, though with ſome tincture of <hi>Eraſtus</hi> his Doctrine, which diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all Eccleſiaſticall Power into the Secular, in States that are Chriſtian. Here, I thought it worth the while to try, how the reaſons heretofore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced might be improved, not onely
<pb facs="tcp:115786:3"/> to eſtabliſh the Society of the Church, upon the Power of the Keys granted by our Lord, or to declare what perſons, and upon what terms, it is truſted with, on behalf of the Church, and every part of it, (which I had begun to doe afore) but in what Right and Intereſt, the Secular Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er concurres to the effect of it, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing or reforming the Church of any Chriſtian State. This is the reaſon that I referre ſo often to thoſe two Diſcourſes, intending at the firſt, but to ſupply, and improve what I had ſaid. But, finding by the proceſſe, that I could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the brevity which I firſt aimed at, I have added a Review, whereby, as ſome parts are inlarged, ſo, the whole perhaps remains not ſo ſutable, becauſe other points, that might ſeem to require the like enlargement,
<pb facs="tcp:115786:3"/> are left as they were, becauſe an end muſt be made. My reaſons are generall to all States, and all parts of the Church: and that generality will make them obſcure, to ſuch as conſider them not, as the conſequence of the ſubject de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. But it is well, if a ſubject contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſo great difference of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, can be compriſed in any gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall truth. Many things might have been better ſaid, could all have been Copied again; But a ſingle heart will make the beſt of all that, which is tendred with no other deſign, but to remonſtrate, how hard it is, and yet to ſhew how it is poſſible, to keep, or recover the Conſcience of a good Chriſtian, in ſuch a triall as this. I had a deſire to have added herewith, to the other two Diſcourſes, a Review of ſome paſſages, which, thoſe things which I have ſaid here, give
<pb facs="tcp:115786:4"/> me occaſion to inlarge. But the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies of the Preſſe, and my abſence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force me to deferre it, till opportunity ſerve.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is viſible to all underſtandings that there are two ſtates of Gods Church. For, there muſt needs be a great difference between the Church, as it was firſt eſtabliſhed, by the ordinances of the Apoſtles, before the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Chriſtianity was allowed and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the Laws of the Romane Empire; and as it now ſtandeth, protected by the Laws of Chriſtian Kingdomes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths. And my purpoſe is here to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, what power the Church ought to have in this later ſtate, and what Right accrues
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115786:6"/> to Secular powers in Church matters, when they profeſſe Chriſtianity, and the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of it: Which one diſpute, will neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily conclude the chiefe matters now in compromiſe, concerning the ſtate of the Church in this Kingdome. To underſtand this aright we muſt ſuppoſe, that the Church is not endowed with any manner of the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar power of this world, and the civill Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it, which conſtraineth men to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by force. For it will be eaſie for ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary underſtandings, after the miſerable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes which this civill Warre hath advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, to perceive, that though there be many points of that Right, wherein Soveraign Power conſiſteth, yet all of them are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the Power of the Sword: Seeing that there is no manner of publick Act, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Soveraign Power, or any derived from it, that could be effectuall, as the uſe of civill Society requires, did not all mens ſenſes tell them, that there is force ready, to reduce the refractary to obedience. Now, that our Saviour did, and was to diſclaim all Title to the Sword, is manifeſt by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, and the profeſſion of it. For, being ſuſpected in his life time by his enemies, and laſtly accuſed to <hi>Pilate,</hi> as one that ſought to uſurp it, his renouncing it ſo publickly, becauſe it clears him, therefore convinces
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115786:6"/> the injuſtice of the ſentence againſt him. And truly, what entertainment ſhall we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine his Goſpel would have found in the world, had it pretended to eſtabliſh itſelf by force? For, this profeſſion, muſt needs have produced that effect, which Mahumetiſme did afterwards, to wit, the ſubverſion of all States, which it might prove able to juſtle with and to prevaile. But, Chriſtianity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt initiated by the Croſſe of Chriſt, and profeſſing nothing, but to follow him in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Croſſe, it is manifeſt, that thoſe which ſaw not reaſon to beleeve it, muſt be convinced, that they ought not to perſecute it. For, if it preſerve the power of the Sword, in thoſe hands, wherein it is found, when the Goſpel is preached, and received any where, then, of neceſſity, all Rights, all goods of this world, in the poſſeſſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Power of the Sword profeſſes to maintain all Subjects, are, by the Goſpel, maintained in thoſe hands, that have them by juſt title of Humane Right. And ſo, that which I here ſuppoſe, is no more then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Poſition of Divines, That temporall dominion is not founded in Grace: For, mens Rights, Powers, and Priviledges, in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Societies, are no leſſe their own, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern their eſtate no leſſe, then their Goods and Poſſeſſions. Therefore, though much
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115786:7"/> more evidence might be brought to prove this, from the Apoſtles, commanding Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to obey ſecular Powers, children their Parents, ſlaves their Maſters, wives their Husbands, and the like, according to the Laws, but above the Laws, for conſcience to God, obliging thereby all States, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Chriſtianity; yet, this being a point, which no party profeſſes to ſtick at, I will hereupon preſume to take it for granted.</p>
               <p>But, though the Church is not endowed with any coactive power, by Divine Right, yet, by Divine Right, and by Patent from God, it is endowed with a Power of holding Aſſemblies, for the Common Service of God, before any grant of the Powers of the world, and againſt any Interdict of them, if ſo it fall out. For, the Communion which the Goſpel eſtabliſheth among Chriſtians, is not onely inviſible, in the heart, beleeving the ſame Faith, and diſpoſed to live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it, but alſo outwardly viſible, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Profeſſion of the ſame Faith, which may be common to thoſe that communicate in nothing elſe, but alſo in the Common Service of God; For, ſeeing God hath given his Church the Ordinances of his worſhip, wherewith he requireth to be ſerved in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon by his Church, ſome of them common both to the Church and the Synagogue, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115786:7"/> is, to Jews and Chriſtians, others, delivered by the Goſpel onely to the Church, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that the Church is priviledged by God, becauſe commanded, to join in ſerving him according to thoſe Ordinances. And therefore, we are not to ask an expreſſe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in Scripture, for this, whether duty, or priviledge, becauſe it was always in force among the people of God, though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways free from the bondage of ſtrangers. The Apoſtle truly, writing to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> not to fall away from Chriſtianity to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſme, for the perſecutions, which the Jews their natives brought upon them, (which, he that will diligently obſerve, ſhall finde to be the full ſcope of that Epiſtle) inferreth, as a conſequence, <hi>Heb.</hi> X. 25. <hi>not to forſake the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling of themſelves:</hi> Shewing, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity cannot be profeſſed without ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though it bring perſecution with it: As, we know, the Primitive Chriſtians frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Service of God, when they were in danger of the Laws, becauſe, that which the Laws forbade, was their Aſſemblies. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as within ſeverall Commonwealths, there are particular Societies, Colleges, and Corporations, ſubſiſting by grant of their Soveraigns. And as, by the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there is a kinde of Society, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, among thoſe that are bound in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115786:8"/> the ſame veſſell, upon the ſame voyage, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> cals <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, as there is alſo among them that travell together in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravans of the Eaſt, becauſe they ſubmit to ſome Rule, in regard of ſome common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs: So muſt we underſtand the Church, to be a humane, though not a civill Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Corporation, or Commonwealth: Not as theſe laſt named, which conſiſt of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to ſeverall States, warranted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by the Law of Nations, nor as the former, by Charter from ſome Soveraign, but by that Law of God, whereby all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are called to ſerve him, by thoſe Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances which he hath eſtabliſhed in the Church. Therefore the main point of that Charter, which makes the Church ſuch a Society or Commonwealth, is the right of Aſsembling, and holding ſuch Aſsemblies, without warrant, againſt all Law of the world that forbids it: The particulars of it are thoſe rights, which God hath given his Church, to preſerve unity, and communion in the celebration of thoſe Ordinances, for which it aſſembleth. For, ſince the principles of Chriſtianity profeſſe one Church, and that the unity thereof extendeth to this viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble communion, it is manifeſt hereby, that the will of God is, that all Chriſtians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with all Chriſtians, in all Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115786:8"/> of his ſervice, when occaſion requires; a thing which the practice of all ſides confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. For, though this communion be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with ſo many Schiſmes, yet, ſince all parties labour to ſhew, that the cauſe of ſeparation is not on their ſide, they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge all ſeparation, to be againſt Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, when they labour to clear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the blame of it.</p>
               <p>In the next place we are to inquire, upon what Title of Right, the Church is ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed into civill Societies and Soveraignties, by vertue whereof, ſecular Powers exerciſe that right to which they pretend, in Church matters. For, I perceive, thoſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations oftentimes demand, what ground we have in Scripture for Nationall Churches. Now, the term of Nationall Churches, it ſeems, is ſomething unproper, becauſe, as one and the ſame Nation may be divided into ſeverall Soveraignties, and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches thereof, by conſequence, ſubject to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Soveraigns, ſo may the ſame Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty contain ſeverall Nations, and the Churches of them, which, in theſe caſes, are not properly Nationall Churches, and yet are properly that which is ſignified by the term of Nationall Churches. But, ſetting aſide this exception, I conceive, thoſe of the Congregations have reaſon to make the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115786:9"/> and that the anſwer to it, if once well made, will be of conſequence, to ſettle many things in debate. For, that the ſame right, in matters of Religion, is due to Chriſtian Princes and States, which the Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> practiſed under the Law, of it ſelf no way appears, becauſe of the generall difference between the Law and the Goſpel. To which may be added, to tie the knot faſter, that there is this clear difference between them, in the particular in hand, that the Law was confined to one People, as being the condition of that Covenant, whereby God undertook to give them the Land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and to maintain them in the free and happy poſſeſſion of it; they undertaking on their part, to ſerve him, and rule themſelves by it: But the Goſpell is the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, by which God undertakes to give life everlaſting, to thoſe that take up Chriſts Croſſe, to perform it. The perſons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of whom the Church conſiſts, being of all Nations, all of them of equall intereſſe, in that wherein they communicate, and therefore in the Rules, by which: It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that no Soveraign can have more inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe then another, in creating that right, by vertue whereof, the Subjects of ſeverall So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignties communicate. Otherwiſe, the Unity of the Church muſt needs ſuffer, one
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115786:9"/> Soveraign preſcribing that, as neceſſary to the communion of the Church in his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which the Soveraigns over other parts of the Church, perhaps, allow not. But though, as a Divine, I admit this debate, yet as a Chriſtian and a Divine both, I condemne the ſeparation which they have made, before it be decided. The Church of <hi>England</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to the King, that power in Church mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which the Kings of Gods ancient peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Chriſtian Emperours after them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways practiſed. This poſseſſion was enough to have kept Unity, though the reaſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not, why Chriſtian Princes ſhould have the ſame right in the Church, as the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> had in the Synagogue. For, if they obſerve it well, this right is no where eſtabliſhed upon the Kings of Gods ancient people, by way of precept, in the Law. For, ſeeing the Law commanded them not to have a King, but gave them leave to have a King when they would, upon ſuch terms as it requireth, <hi>Deut.</hi> XVII. 14. it cannot be ſaid, that any Right in matters of Religion is ſetled upon the King, by that Law, which never provided that there ſhould be a King. The queſtion is then, not, whether the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> had power in matters of Religion, which is expreſs in Scripture, but upon what Title they had it, which is not to be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115786:10"/> had but by Interpretation of the Law. And this we ſhall finde, if we conſider, that the Law was given to that people, when they were freed from bondage, and inveſted in the Soveraign power of themſelves, as to a Body Politick, ſuch as they became, by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to it. So that, though many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts thereof concern the conſcience of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, yet there are alſo many, that take hold of the community of the people, for which, particular perſons cannot be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable, further then the Rate of that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by which they act in it: As, the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Malefactors, Idolaters in particular. Theſe Precepts then, being given to the community of the People, and the common Power of the People falling to the King, conſtituted according to the Law aforeſaid, it followeth, that being inveſted with the Power, he ſtands thereby countable, for the Laws to be inforced by it. And then, the queſtion that remains will be no more but this, Whether civill Societies, and the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Powers of them, are called to be Chriſtian, as ſuch, and not onely as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons. A thing which <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſeems to have doubted of, when he made an <hi>if</hi> of it, <hi>Apologet. cap.</hi> XXI. <hi>Si poſſent eſſe &amp; Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res Chriſtiani; If Emperours could be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> And <hi>Origen,</hi> when he expounds the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115786:10"/> words of <hi>Moſes, I will provoke them to jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, by a people which are not a people,</hi> (ſo he reads it) of the Chriſtians, whereof there were ſome in all Nations, and no whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion profeſſed Chriſtianity; <hi>in</hi> X <hi>ad Rom. lib.</hi> VIII. <hi>&amp; in Pſal.</hi> XXXVI. <hi>Hom.</hi> I. ſeems to count this eſtate and condition, eſſentiall to the Church. But, ſince Anabaptiſts are no more Anabaptiſts, in denying the power of the Sword to be conſiſtent with Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, it ſeems there is no queſtion left about this, as indeed there ought to be none. For, the Propheſies, which went before, of the calling of the Gentiles to Chriſtianity, were not fulfilled, till the Romane Empire profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to maintain it. And, thereby, the will of God being fulfilled, it is manifeſt that the will of God is, that civill Societies, &amp; the Powers of them, ſhould maintain Chriſtianity by their Sword, and the Acts to which it ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth. But always, with that difference from the Synagogue, which hath been expreſſed. For, if the Church ſubſiſt in ſeverall Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignties, the power which each of them can have in Church matters, muſt needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, by that power which God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in his Church, for the determining of ſuch things, the determining whereof ſhall become neceſſary to preſerve the Unity of it.</p>
               <p>Thus much premiſed, the firſt point we
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115786:11"/> are to debate is, Whether Excommunication be a ſecular puniſhment amounting to an Outlawry, or Baniſhment, as <hi>Eraſtus</hi> would have it, or the chiefe act of Eccleſiaſticall Power, the Power of the Spirituall Sword of the Church, cutting from the viſible communion thereof, ſuch as are lawfully preſumed to be cut off from the inviſible, by ſin. For, if there be a viſible Society of the Church, founded by God, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence from man, there muſt be in it a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible power, to determine, who ſhall be or not be members of it: which, by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, is the Soveraign Power in the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the Church, as the Power of the Sword is in civill Societies. But Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication in the Synagogue, was a temporall puniſhment, ſuch as I ſaid, and therefore it is argued, that our Lord meant not of that, when he ſaid, <hi>Dic Eccleſiae,</hi> that terme, in the Old Teſtament, being uſed for the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Gods people, in the quality of a civill Society. And therefore when he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>Let him he unto thee as a Heathen or a publican,</hi> they ſay it is manifeſt, that neither Ethnicks nor Publicans were excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate out of the Synagogue, nor the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate excluded from the Service of God in the Temple or Synagogue: And when our Lord addeth, <hi>Whatſoever ye binde and</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:115786:11"/> 
                  <hi>looſe on earth—</hi>it is manifeſt, ſay they, in the language of the Jews, uſed among the Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud Doctors, that <hi>bound and looſe</hi> is nothing elſe, but that which is declared to be bound or looſe, that is, prohibited &amp; permitted, and therefore the effect of the Keyes of the Church, which is binding and looſing, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches no further, then declaring what was lawfull, and what unlawfull (as to the Jews, by the Law of <hi>Moſes,)</hi> in point of conſcience.</p>
               <p>The firſt argument that I make againſt this opinion, is drawn from the Power of Baptizing, thereby underſtanding, not the Office of miniſtring, but the Right of gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that Sacrament: Which we, in this ſtate of the Church, doe not diſtinguiſh, becauſe all are born within the pale of the Church, and by order thereof, baptized infants: But may ſee a neceſſary ground ſo to diſtinguiſh, by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he denies, <hi>that he was ſent to baptize, but to preach the Goſpel,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> I. 17. whereas the words of our Lord in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel are manifeſt, where he chargeth his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles <hi>to Preach and Teach all Nations, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</hi> For the Baptizing of all that ſhould turn Chriſtians, could not be perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally commanded the Apoſtles, but to preach to all Nations, and to make Diſciples out of all Nations, this they might doe to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115786:12"/> thoſe that might be Baptized, by ſuch as they ſhould appoint. We muſt note, that it is in the Originall, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>make Diſciples,</hi> as the Syriack truly tranſlates it: Commanding firſt, to bring men to be Diſciples, then to Baptize. Now, Diſciples are thoſe that were after called Chriſtians, ſuch as we profeſſe our ſelves, <hi>Acts</hi> XI. 26. thoſe of whom our Lord ſaith in the Goſpel, that <hi>thoſe that will doe his Fathers will are his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples.</hi> Wherefore they are commanded to Baptize ſuch as ſhould ſubmit to the Goſpel: And ſo, to judge, whether each man did ſo or not, which, they that were truſted with the Goſpel, were, by conſequence, truſted to judge. The effect of this truſt is ſeen in the many Orders and Canons of the Primitive Church, by which, thoſe that deſired to be admitted into the Church by Baptiſme, are limited to the triall of ſeverall years, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their profeſſion, whether ſincere or not. And, ſuch as gained their living by ſuch Trades, as Chriſtianity allowed not, rejected, untill they renounced them. Not that my intent is to ſay that theſe Canons were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by the Apoſtles: But becauſe it is an argument, that always, to judge who ſhall be admitted to Baptiſme, and who not, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of power then to baptize, being the power of them that were able to ſettle
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115786:12"/> ſuch Canons. Though it is plain by the Scriptures, that thoſe Rules had their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the Apoſtles themſelves. For, when S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> III. 21. that <hi>the Baptiſme which ſaveth us, is not the laying down the filth of the fleſh, but the examination of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to God;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: he ſheweth, that the Interrogatories which the ancient Church uſed to propound to them that were to be baptized, were then in uſe; and eſtabliſhed by the Apoſtles, as the condition of a contract between the Church and them, obliging themſelves to live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Goſpel, as Diſciples. And the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> VI. 2. ſpeaking of <hi>the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of repentance from dead works, the doctrine of Baptiſms and impoſition of Hands:</hi> mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly ſhews the ſucceeding cuſtome of the Church, that they which ſued for Baptiſme, ſhould be catechized in the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and contract with the Church to forſake ſuch courſes of the world as ſtood not with it, to be brought in by the Apoſtles. This is it which is here called the doctrine of Baptiſms in the plurall number, not for that frantick reaſon which the diſtemper of this time hath brought forth, becauſe there are two Baptiſmes, one of <hi>John</hi> by water, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by the Spirit; but, becauſe it was ſeverally taught ſeverall perſons before
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115786:13"/> they were admitted to their ſeveral Baptiſms. And therefore called alſo the Doctrine of <hi>Impoſition of Hands,</hi> becauſe we underſtand by <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Paedag.</hi> III. 11. and by the Apoſtolicall Conſtitutions VII. 40. that, when they came to the Church to be cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chized, and were catechized, they were then diſmiſſed by him that catechized them, with Impoſition of Hands, that is, with prayer for them, that they might, in due time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come good Chriſtians. All, viſible marks of the power of the Church, in judging whether a man were fit for Baptiſme or not. To which I will adde onely that of <hi>Euſebius, De vitâ Conſtant.</hi> IV. where ſpeaking of the Baptiſme of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> he ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that <hi>confeſsing his ſinnes, hee was admitted to prayer with Impoſition of hands.</hi> If it be ſaid, that there were added to the Church three thouſand in a day, <hi>Acts</hi> II. 41. which could not be thus catechized and tried; my anſwer is, that two caſes were always exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted from the Rule: The firſt was in danger of death: The ſecond, when, by the eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thoſe that deſired Baptiſm, the hand of God appeared extraordinary in the work of their converſion to Chriſtianity. Beſides, it is not ſaid that they were baptized that day; but that <hi>they were added to the Church that</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:115786:13"/> 
                  <hi>day:</hi> Which is true, though they onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed themſelves Diſciples for the preſent, paſſing nevertheleſſe their examination, and inſtruction, as the caſe required. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there be a power, ſetled in the Church by God, to judge, who is fit to be admitted into it, then is the ſame power inabled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe him that ſhall appear unfit, then, by the ſame reaſon, to exclude him, that proves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unfit, after he is admitted.</p>
               <p>This is the next argument, which I will ground upon the Diſcipline of Penance, as it was anciently practiſed in the Church: Which is opened by the obſervation advanced in the 127 <hi>p.</hi> of this little Diſcourſe, that thoſe, who, contrary to this contract with the Church, fell into ſins deſtructive to Chriſtianity, were fain to ſue to be admitted to Penance: Which ſuppoſeth, that, till they had given ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ſincerity in Chriſtianity, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſtrangers to the Communion of the Church. For, it appeareth, by the moſt ancient of Church Writers, that, for divers ages, the greateſt Sinners, as Apoſtates, Murtherers, &amp; Adulterers, were wholly excluded from Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. For though <hi>Tertullian</hi> was a Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, when he cried out upon <hi>Zephyrinus</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> for admitting Adulterers to Penance, in his Book <hi>De Pudicitiâ,</hi> yet it is manifeſt by his caſe, that it had formerly

                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:115786:15"/> been refuſed in the Church, becauſe the granting of it makes him a Montaniſt. And S. <hi>Cyprian Epiſt. ad Antonianum,</hi> teſtifieth, that divers <hi>African</hi> Biſhops afore him, had refuſed it, maintaining communion never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe with thoſe that granted it. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> alſo I. 9. ſaith, of a certain woman, that had been ſeduced and defiled by <hi>Marcus</hi> the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, that, after ſhe was brought to the ſight of her ſin, by ſome Chriſtians, ſhe ſpent all her days in bewalling it: Therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out recovering the communion of the Church again. And he that ſhall but look upon the Canons of the Eliberitane Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, ſhall eaſily ſee many kindes of ſins cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, ſome of them, not to be admitted to communion till the point, others not at the point of death. In this caſe, and in this eſtate, theſe onely, who were excluded from being admitted to Penance were properly excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate; neither could thoſe that were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Penance be abſolutely counted ſo, becauſe in danger of death, they were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Communion, though, in caſe they recovered, they ſtood bound to compleat their Penance. And from hence afterwards alſo, thoſe that had once been admitted to Penance, if they fell into the like ſins again, were not to be admitted to Penance the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time. <hi>Concil.

It is an eaſie thing to ſay, that this Rigor, was an infirmity in the Church of thoſe times, not underſtanding aright free Juſtification by Faith: But as it is manifeſt, that this rigor of diſcipline abated more and more, age by age, till that now it is come to nothing: So, if we goe upwards, and compare the writings of the Apoſtles, with the Originall practice of the Church, it will appear, that the rigor of it was brought in by them, becauſe it aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by degrees from age to age, till at length it is almoſt quite loſt; that the Reformation of the Church conſiſts in retaining it, that we ſhall doe ſo much prejudice to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as we ſhall, by undue interpretation, make Juſtification by Faith inconſiſtent with it. And, in fine, it will appear, that all Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance preſuppoſeth Excommunication, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely ſome abatement of it. <hi>There is a ſin unto death,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> V. 16. <hi>I ſay not</hi> that <hi>ye pray for it.</hi> This is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood, of denying Gods truth, againſt that light which convinceth the conſcience. Which, if it were true, the Apoſtles precept could never come into practice, ſeeing no man can know, unleſſe by Revelation, againſt what light his Neighbour ſinneth. But the Novatians, at the Councell of Nice, as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:115786:16"/> and <hi>Sozomenus</hi> both report, <hi>Eccleſ. Hiſt.</hi> I. 7.

And ſo alſo <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> in many places of his Book <hi>de Pudicit.</hi> as <hi>cap.</hi> XIV. argueth from this place, that Penance was not to be granted to Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.

But the words of S. <hi>James,</hi> V. 16. have cleared me of this doubt, <hi>Confeſſe your ſins one to another,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and pray for one another, that ye may be healed:</hi> In which words, I make no doubt but he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of publique Penance. For having premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>that the Presbyters be ſent for to the ſick, that they confeſſe their ſins to the Presbyters, that they pray for them, anointing them with oil, that their ſins may be forgiven them,</hi> to ſhew nevertheleſſe, that, according to the cuſtome aforeſaid, in caſe they recovered,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115786:16"/> they were to ſtand bound to Penance, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>Confeſſe your ſins to one another—</hi>to ſignifie, that this Confeſſion and Penance remained due before the Church, as we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by the XII Canon of Nice, that the practice was ſo long afterwards. And this is proved, by the precept of both Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>to pray for one another.</hi> For it is manifeſt, that there were two means to obtain remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins, in this caſe; the Humiliation which the Church preſcribed, and the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent performed, and the Prayers of the Church.

               <p>The very ſame is the meaning of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> VI. 6. when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth it <hi>unpoſsible, that thoſe that fall away, be renued again to Repentance.</hi> For, as they that ſtood for Baptiſme, when they were catechized in Chriſtianity, were properly ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, to be renewed, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and dedicated again to Repentance: And the Apoſtles reaſon agrees; For, <hi>becauſe the earth that receives rain, and renders no</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:115786:17"/> 
                  <hi>fruit, is near the curſe,</hi> therefore the Church will not eaſily beleeve, that ſuch a one ſhall lightly obtain of God, the grace to become a ſincere Chriſtian. And therefore, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſays not, that it is unpoſſible, that ſuch a one ſhould repent, <hi>but that he ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed again to repentance,</hi> to wit, by the Church. As the Novatians anſwered <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> that they remitted ſuch perſons to God, not prejudicing their ſalvation, but not admitting them to the means of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Church. And herewith agreeth the example of <hi>Eſau,</hi> uſed by the Apoſtle again XII. 17. ſaying that <hi>he found not place of Repentance,</hi> alluding to that roome in the Church, where Penitents were placed apart by themſelves. And again, X. 26. the alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he maketh to the cuſtome under the Law, underſtood by the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to whom he writeth, conſiſteth in this, that, as there was no ſacrifice to be made for Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, though for Ethnicks, (for this was the uſe of the Law, as we underſtand by <hi>Moſes Maimoni</hi> in the Title of Dreſſing Oblations <hi>cap.</hi> III. <hi>num.</hi> 3, 5.) So, the Chriſtian Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, of the Prayers of the Church, was not to be offered, for thoſe that had renounced Chriſtianity. If it be thus, you will ask, What was the fault of the Novatians, ſeeing they underſtood this Text right? And my anſwer
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115786:17"/> is, that nevertheleſſe they are Hereticks, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the name of Hereticks, to thoſe whom now we call Schiſmaticks, as I have ſhewed you, in the little Diſcourſe, <hi>pag.</hi> 197. that it is often uſed. For S. <hi>John,</hi> as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands not, ſo he forbids not, that they be admitted to Penance, the other Apoſtle tels them, <hi>it is impoſsible,</hi> to let them know, that they muſt not expect it: But neither ſays, that the Church could not give it. When therefore the Church, to preſerve Unity, was neceſſitated to grant it, as we ſee by S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> the Novatians were no leſſe Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, in making ſeparation upon the quarrell, (though perhaps the reaſon be not urged by their adverſaries) then if they had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Text amiſſe: The Unity of the Church, being of more moment, then much underſtanding in the Scriptures. And ſo, perhaps, S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words will belong to this purpoſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 19. as, not onely the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians of late, but <hi>Pacianus</hi> among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, <hi>Paraen. ad Poenitentiam,</hi> and <hi>Matthaeus Galenus</hi> among modern Writers, do expound them: To wit, that when he ſaith, <hi>Lay hands ſuddenly on no men, nor partake of other mens ſins:</hi> he leaves it to <hi>Timothies</hi> judgement, whom to admit, whom not to admit to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: Becauſe this Bleſſing with Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hands, was not the mark of Abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115786:18"/> but of admiſſion to Penance, as well as the ceremony of Ordinations. And though this Text of the Apoſtle, be underſtood in particular of Ordinations, yet, by the ſame reaſon which he allegeth, it is to be extended to all Acts of the Church, that are bleſſed, by the Prayers of the Church, with Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hands. For if <hi>Timothy,</hi> by Impoſing hands upon thoſe whom he Ordains, become acceſſary to their ſins, if they be unfit to be Ordained; by the ſame reaſon, if he Impoſe Hands, that is, grant Penance unto them that are not fit for it, he becomes acceſſory to the ſins which they commit by being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to it. Impoſition of Hands being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but a ceremony of that Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ſignifieth, that thoſe Acts to which it is granted, are allowed and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by the publique Power of the Church. So Impoſition of Hands in Confirmation, is the admiſſion of him that is confirmed to the communion of the Viſible Church; In Penance, the reſtoring of him: In Ordination, to the exerciſe of this or that function in the Church: Prayer, over the ſick, which the Apoſtle commands, <hi>James</hi> V. 14. and our Lord in the Goſpel made with Impoſition of Hands, ſignified the admitting of the ſick to Penance: And it is ſaid, that in ſome Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Churches, to this day, mariages are bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115786:18"/> with Impoſition of Hands, in ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Church alloweth of them, which, as it was alwayes the right of the Church to doe, as I ſhall obſerve in another place, ſo it appeareth ſo to be, in that mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was never celebrated among Chriſtians, without the Prayers of the Church. And this obſervation I inſiſt upon the more chearfully, becauſe it much ſtrengtheneth the argument, which the Church maketh, for the Baptiſm of Infants, from the Act of our Saviour in the Goſpel, when he bleſſed the Infants with Impoſition of Hands. For if all Impoſition of Hands be an act of the publique Power of the Church, allowing that which is done with it, then can this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands ſignifie no leſſe, then, that thoſe to whom our Lord granteth it, belong to his Kingdome of the Viſible Church. One little objection there lies againſt this, from the inceſtuous perſon at <hi>Corinth,</hi> whom S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his ſecond Epiſtle, ſeems to readmit to communion, his crime being as deep as Adultery, which, we ſay, the rigor of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall Diſcipline admitted not to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. To which I have divers things to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. That this cannot be objected, but by him that acknowledges, that he was excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate by the former Epiſtle. That <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> in his Book <hi>de Pudicitiâ,</hi> diſputes at
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115786:19"/> large, that it is not the ſame caſe which is ſpoken of in both Epiſtles. That the crime here ſpecified, perhaps, is not of the number of thoſe, which from the beginning were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from Penance. But, waving all this, as I excepted two caſes, in which men were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized without regular triall, ſo ſuppoſing the Rule to take hold in this caſe, it is no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to grant, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> might wave the rigor of Diſcipline, ſo ſetled, as ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing there might be cauſe to wave it. If this opinion ſeem new, my purpoſe requires but theſe two Points, that the Penance practiſed by the ancient Church, ſuppoſed Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, which it only abateth: and, that it was inſtituted by the Apoſtles; and, for that, there is enough ſaid, I ſuppoſe, even to them that beleeve not, that the Apoſtles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded any kinde of crimes from Penance. Beſides that of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> blaming the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> that <hi>they were puffed up, and had not rather lamented, that he that had done the evil, might be put from among them,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> V. 2. And again, fearing, that <hi>when he returned, he ſhould be forced to lament many,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> XII. 21. Which, if we compare with the Primitive ſolemnity of Excommunication, which by the conſtitutions of the Apoſtles, II. 16. and other ways, we underſtand, was, to put the perſon out of the Church doors with mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115786:19"/> it will appear, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> is in the right, in expounding this later Text to this purpoſe, <hi>Haer.</hi> LIX. <hi>num.</hi> 5. The power of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication then, by all this, is no more, then the neceſſary conſequence, of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of admitting to Communion, by Baptiſm: Which, if it imply a contract with the Church, to live according to the rule of Chriſtianity, then it is forfeit to him, that evidently does that, which cannot ſtand with that rule, and the Church not tied to reſtore it, but as the perſon can give ſatisfaction, to obſerve it for the future.</p>
               <p>Now, I will make ſhort work with <hi>Eraſtus</hi> his long labour, to prove, that there is no Excommunication commanded by the Law. I yeeld it. And make a conſequence, which will be thought a ſtrange one: But I have it from the ſpeculation of <hi>Origen, in Levit: Hom.</hi> XI. and others, why the Church ſhould onely be inabled to Excommunicate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Synagogue was inabled to put to death? From the obſervation of S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, Quaeſt. in Deuteronom.</hi> V. 38. <hi>de Fide &amp; Operibus cap.</hi> VI. and others, that Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication in the Church is the ſame that the power of life and death in the Synagogue. My argument is then, that the Church is to have the power of Excommunication, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Synagogue had the power of life
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115786:20"/> and death. And the reaſon of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence this: Becauſe, as the Law, being the condition of the Covenant, by which, the benefit of the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was due, inabled to put to death, ſuch as deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it: So the Goſpel, being the condition of the Covenant, that makes men denizons of the ſpirituall Jeruſalem, muſt inable, to put them from the ſociety thereof that forfeited it. It is not my intent hereby to ſay, that there was no Excommunication under the Law: For, I doe beleeve, that we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it in <hi>Ezra</hi> X. 8. grounded, if I miſtake not, upon the Commiſſion of the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> recorded <hi>Ezr.</hi> VII. 26. for, that which is here called <hi>rooting out,</hi> ſeems to be the ſame, that is called in the other place, <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the Synagogue of the Captives.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed, a kinde of temporall Outlawry, to which is joined, confiſcation of Goods. For, ſo ſaith <hi>Luther</hi> truly, that the greater Excommunication among Chriſtians, is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where a temporall puniſhment, to wit, in regard of ſome temporall puniſhment atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, in Chriſtian States, which, in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, is accidentall, by Act of thoſe States, in Judaiſme eſſentiall, ſo long as thoſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall advantages, which were the eſſentiall condition of the Law, were not forfeited. And this, without doubt, is the ſame puniſhment,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115786:20"/> which the Goſpels call <hi>putting out of the Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agogue:</hi> Though, I cannot ſay, ſo perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory, for the temporall effects of it: Which, ſeverall Soveraigns could eaſily limit, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall terms. For, the right that <hi>Ezra</hi> might have, to introduce this penalty, is clear, by the Law, of <hi>Deut.</hi> XVII. 12. which, inabling to put them to death, that obeyed not the Synagogue, inabled, to Excommunicate, to Baniſh, to Outlaw them, much more. But, as, we ſee, the Romanes allowed them not the power of life and death, which the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians granted them, ſo I am not to grant, that, putting out of the Synagogue in the Goſpel, implieth the extinguiſhing, of the civill being of any Jew. The Talmud Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ſay, that, thoſe that were under the greater Excommunication, were to dwell in a cotage alone, and to have meat and drink brought them, till they died. <hi>Arba Turim,</hi> or <hi>Shulchan Auroh,</hi> in <hi>Jore Dea, Hilcoth Nid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dui Voherem.</hi> A ſpeculation ſutable to their condition, in their diſperſions, which, no man is bound to beleeve, how far it was in force, and practice. But, ſuppoſe the Synagogue in the ſame condition with the Church afore <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> injoying no privilege, but to ſerve God according to the Law, as the Church according to the Goſpel: And then, as the Synagogue muſt always have power
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115786:21"/> to excommunicate, which had power to put to death; ſo, I ſay, is the Church inabled by our Lord to doe, what, I have ſhewed, the Apoſtles did doe, by <hi>Mat.</hi> XVIII. 18. I yeeld, that the terms of <hi>binding and looſing,</hi> are uſed by the Jews, to ſignifie, the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, of what is prohibited and permitted by the Law: But I yeeld not, that it can be ſo underſtood here, becauſe, the ground of this declaration ceaſeth, under the Goſpel; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing derived from the ſixe hundreth and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Precepts of the Law, and from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Prieſts and Doctors, to determine all caſes, which the Law had not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in dependence upon the great Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at Jeruſalem, by the Law of <hi>Deut.</hi> XVII. 12. which Precepts, and which Power, being voided by the Goſpel, can any man think, that the Power of <hi>binding and looſing,</hi> here given the Church, is to be underſtood of it? Beſides, it is, in the promiſe made to S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Mat.</hi> XVI. 19. ſaid expreſly, to be the act of the Power of the Keys. And what is that? Is it not an expreſſion, manifeſtly bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, from that which is ſaid to <hi>Eliakim</hi> ſonne of <hi>Hilkiah, Eſ.</hi> XXII. 23. <hi>I will give thee the Keys of the Houſe of David:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon our Lord, <hi>Apoc.</hi> III. 7. is ſaid to have <hi>the Key of David,</hi> that is, of the Houſe of <hi>David?</hi> whereby the Apoſtles under our
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115786:21"/> Lord, are made Stewards of the Church, as <hi>Eliakim</hi> of the Court, to admit and exclude whom he pleaſed. And ſo it is manifeſt, that the Power of the Keys, given S. <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> XVI. 19. as the Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> XVIII. 18. is that power, which you have ſeen practiſed under the Apoſtles, of admitting to, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding from the Church, by Baptiſm and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. So S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> expreſly underſtandeth the Power of the Keys to conſiſt in Baptizing. <hi>Ep.</hi> LXXIII. And of Penance, that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth is an expreſſe argument, as I have obſerved <hi>p.</hi> 129. of that ſhort Diſcourſe: For having ſaid, <hi>whatſoever ye binde—</hi>he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth immediately, <hi>again I ſay to you, that if two of you agree to ask any thing, it ſhall be done you by my Father in heaven.</hi> For the means of pardon, being the Humiliation of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, injoined by the Church, and joined with the prayers thereof, as hath been ſaid, the conſequence of our Saviours diſcourſe, firſt, of informing the Church, then, of bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and looſing, laſtly, of granting the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Church, ſhews, that he ſpeaks of thoſe prayers, which ſhould be made, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of ſuch, as were bound, for not hearing the Church. And hereby we ſee, how bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; looſing of ſins, is attributed to the Keys of the Church. Which, being made a Viſible Society, by the power of holding Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115786:22"/> to which no man is to be admitted, till there be juſt preſumption, that he is of the heavenly Jeruſalem, that is above: As the power of judging, who is and who is not thus qualified, preſuppoſes a profeſſion, ſo, that, an Inſtruction, obliging the obedience of them, which ſeek remiſſion of ſinnes by the Goſpel, and therefore, confidently aſſuring it, to them which conform themſelves. In a word, becauſe, admitting to, and excluding from the Church, is, or ought to be, a juſt and lawfull preſumption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of admitting to, or excluding from heaven, it is morally, and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally, the ſame Act, that intitleth to heaven, and to the Church, that maketh an heir of life everlaſting, and a Chriſtian, becauſe, he that obeyeth the Church, in ſubmitting to the Goſpel, is as certainly, a member of the inviſible, as of the viſible Church. Herewith agree the words of our Lord, <hi>Let him be unto thee as a Heathen and a Publican:</hi> Not as if Heathens could be excommunicate the Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agogue, who never were of it, or, as if the Jews then durſt excommunicate Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes, that levied Taxes for the Romanes: But becauſe, by their uſage, of Publicanes and Gentiles, it was proper for our Lord to ſignifie, how he would have Chriſtians to uſe the excommunicate; there being no reaſon why he can be thought, by theſe words, to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115786:22"/> regulate the converſation of the Jews, in that eſtate, ſo long as the Law ſtood, but to give his Church Rules, to laſt till the worlds end. The Jews then, abhorred the company, not onely of Idolaters, to teſtifie how much they abhorred Idols, and to maintain the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in deteſtation of them (by ceremonies, brought in by the Guides of the Synagogue, for that purpoſe) but all thoſe that conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Idolaters. For this cauſe, we ſee, they murmure againſt our Lord, for eating with Publicans; they waſh when they come from market, where commonly they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with Gentiles, and, which is ſtrange, ſuch as <hi>Cornelius</hi> was, being allowed to dwell among them by the Law, profeſſing one God, and taking upon them the precepts of the ſons of <hi>Noe,</hi> yet are the converted Jews ſcandalized at S. <hi>Peter,</hi> for eating with <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Acts</hi> XI. 2. Theſe Rules are made void by the Goſpel. For S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> expreſly, that they are not to forbear the company of Gentiles, for thoſe ſinnes, which their Profeſsion imported; but if a Chriſtian live in any of thoſe Heathen vices, with him, they are not ſo much as to eate, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> V. 11. to wit, as it followeth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, being condemned by the Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a cauſe: For, ſaith he, <hi>What have I to doe to judge them that are without? do not ye</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:115786:23"/> 
                  <hi>judge thoſe that are within? But thoſe that are without, God judgeth: And ye ſhall take the evill man from among you.</hi> That is, are not you, by the power you have, of judging thoſe that are within, to take away him that hath done evill? leaving to God, to judge thoſe without. Here the caſe is plain, there is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Church, to judge, and take away of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders: Of which power the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Tit.</hi> III. 9. when he ſays, that <hi>Hereticks are condemned of themſelves,</hi> if we follow S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes</hi> expoſition, which ſeems unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For experience convinces, that moſt Hereticks think themſelves in the right; ſo farre they are from condemning themſelves, in their conſciences. But, they condemne themſelves, by cutting of themſelves from the Church, which other ſinners are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to by the Church. Neither is it any thing elſe then Excommunication which the Apoſtle ſignifieth, by <hi>delivering to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> V. 6. ſaving, that he expreſſeth an extraordinary effect, that followed it in the Apoſtles time, to wit, that thoſe which were put out of the Church, became viſibly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Satan, inflicting Plagues and diſeaſes on their bodies, which might reduce them to repentance, which the Apoſtle calleth, the <hi>deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> As he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115786:23"/> ſaith of <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> I. 21. <hi>whom I have delivered to Satan that they may learn not to blaſpheme.</hi> For it is not to be doubted, that the Apoſtles had power, like that which S. <hi>Peter</hi> exerciſed on <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> thus to puniſh thoſe that oppoſed them, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> divers times intimates in the Texts which I have quoted in another place: provided by God, as the reſt of miraculous Graces, to evidence his preſence in the Church. Theſe particulars, which I huddle up together by the way, might have been drawn out, into ſeverall arguments, but I content my ſelf with the conſequence, by which, the Patent of this Power in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, is cleared, upon which Patent, all the Power of the Church is grounded. That is, if Chriſtians are onely to abſtain from eating with excommunicate perſons, as Jews did with Publicanes and Gentiles, then Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication is to be underſtood, when our Lord ſaith, <hi>Let him be to thee as a Heathen, and a Publicane.</hi> As for that which is ſaid, that the excommunicate among the Jews, were not excluded either Temple, or Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, therefore it was a ſecular puniſhment: It is a miſtake. That which the Jews call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, was not Excommunication, no more then that, which the Conſtitutions of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is the ſame, being
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115786:24"/> but a ſtep to it, like that which is now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the leſſe Excommunication: And therefore, he that was under this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, among the Jews, was, but in part, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the communion, as well of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred as civill ſociety: For, it hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very learnedly, in the Book of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Keyes, that hee ſtood as much removed from the one as from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe that, as well in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, as at home, no man was to come within his four cubits. But when the Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud Doctors determine, that the excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate dwell in a Cotage apart, and have ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance brought him, ſuch a one was paſt comming into the Temple or Synagogue. And ſo, I ſuppoſe, was he that was put out of the Synagogue, for acknowledging our Lord Chriſt to be a true Prophet, <hi>John</hi> IX. 35. For, they which, afterwards, were wont to curſe all his followers, in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, as <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Dial. cum Tryph.</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius, Haer.</hi> XXX. tell us, that they did in their time, are not like to endure, in their ſociety, whether ſacred or civill, him, that, in their interpretation, was fallen from <hi>Moſes.</hi> And thus is the Power of the Keys clearly grounded upon this Charter of the Goſpel, and all the Right of the Church upon it.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:115786:24"/>
               <p> Onely one Objection yet remains, which to me hath always ſeemed very difficult, for it is manifeſt, that our Lord ſpeaketh here of matters of intereſſe, between party and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when he ſaith, <hi>If thy brother offend thee—</hi>and it may juſtly ſeem ſtrange, that our Lord ſhould give the Church power, to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate thoſe, that will not ſtand to the ſentence of the Church, in ſuch matters. But ſo it is. The Jews, in their diſperſions, were fain to have recourſe to this penalty, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the Juriſdiction of their own Bodies, leſt, if cauſes ſhould be carried thence, before Heathen Courts, Gods name ſhould be blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed, and the Gentiles ſcandalized at his people, ſaying, See what peace and right there is, among thoſe that profeſſe the true God! For the ſame cauſes, our Lord here eſtateth the ſame Power upon the Church. Whereof I cannot give a more ſufficient and effectuall argument, then by ſhewing, that it was in uſe under the Apoſtles: Though the place out of which I ſhall ſhew this, is hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to otherwiſe underſtood, becauſe men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider not, that it is not againſt Chriſtianity, that there be ſeverall ſeats, for ſeverall ranks and dignities of the world, in the Church: And therefore, that it is not that, which the Apoſtle findes fault with, <hi>James</hi> II. 1. when he forbids them <hi>to have the Faith of God with</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:115786:25"/> 
                  <hi>reſpect of perſons.</hi> But the <hi>Synagogue</hi> which he ſpeaketh of in the next words, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, of the Court, where they judged the cauſes and differences, between members of the Church. For, that the Jews were wont to keep Court in their Synagogues, we learn not onely by the Talmud Doctors, <hi>Maimoni</hi> by name, in the Title of Oaths, <hi>cap.</hi> IX. where he ſpeaketh particularly, of the caſe of an Oath made in the Synagogue, when the Court ſate there, but by that which we finde in the New Teſtament, <hi>Mat.</hi> X. 17. XXIII. 34. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIII. 9. <hi>Acts</hi> XXII. 19. XXVI. 11. as wel as in <hi>Epiphanius, Haer.</hi> XXX. that they uſed to ſcourge in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues: To wit, where ſentence was given, there juſtice was executed. Wherefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing converted to Chriſtianity, they held the ſame courſe; as appears by the words of the Apoſtle that follow, <hi>Doe ye not make a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence among your ſelves, and are become Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of evill thoughts?</hi> and again, <hi>If ye accept perſons, ye commit ſin, being reproved by the Law.</hi> By what Law, but by that which ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not accept perſons in judgement? Lev.</hi> XIX. 15. For the execution of which Law, it is expreſly provided, by the Jews Conſtitutions, in <hi>Maimoni, Sanedrin ca.</hi> XXI. that when a poor man and a Rich plead toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Rich ſhall not be bid to ſit down,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115786:25"/> and the poor ſtand or ſit in a worſe place, but both ſit, or both ſtand, which, you ſee, is the particular, for which the Apoſtle char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them, <hi>to have the Faith of Chriſt with reſpect of perſons:</hi> That is, to ſhew favour, in the cauſes of Chriſtians, according to their perſons. The ſame courſe, we may well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, was ſetled by the Apoſtles at <hi>Corinth,</hi> by the blame S. <hi>Paul</hi> charges them with, for going to Law before Infidels. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> VI. 1, 2. For, how ſhould he blame them for doing that, which they had not order before not to doe? And therefore, if our Lord, in this place, give the Church power, to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate thoſe that ſtand not to the ſentence of the Church, much more thoſe that violate the Chriſtianity which they have profeſſed. And this is alſo here expreſſed, when, from the particular he goes to the generall, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Whatſoever ye binde on earth—</hi>giving thereby, the ſame power to the Church here, which he gave to S. <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> XVI. 19. and to the Apoſtles, <hi>John</hi> XX. 22. And ſo, we have here, two Heads, of the cauſes of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication: The firſt, of ſuch things as concern the conſcience and ſalvation of particular Chriſtians, when they commit ſuch ſins as deſtroy Chriſtianity: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, of ſuch, as concern the community of the Church, and the unity thereof, in which,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115786:26"/> not the act, but the contumacy, the not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Church, makes them ſubject to this ſentence.</p>
               <p>It is not my purpoſe to ſay, that theſe nice reaſons are to be the Title, upon which the right of the Church to this power, ſtandeth or falleth: But, that, being in poſſeſſion of it, upon a Title as old as Chriſtianity, and demonſtrable by the ſame evidence, it cannot be ejected out of this poſſeſſion, by any thing in the Scripture, when it is rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. One objection there is more, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to this laſt reaſon, that, if the Church have power to ſentence civile cauſes of Chriſtians, and by Excommunication to inforce that ſentence, when States profeſſe Chriſtianity, all civill Laws will ceaſe, and all Judicatories be reſolved into one Conſiſtory of the Church. The anſwer to this, I deferre, till I come to ſhew, the Right of the States that profeſſe Chriſtianity, in Church mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, where it will eaſily appear, how this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience ceaſeth. In the mean time, the Soveraign power of the Church conſiſting in the Sword of Excommunication, upon which the Society thereof is founded, it is neceſſarily manifeſt, that this power is not loſt to the Church, nor forfeit to the State, that profeſſes Chriſtianity, and undertakes the protection of the Church. For the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115786:26"/> Church, and civill Societies, muſt needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main diſtinct bodies, when the Church is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed into the State, and the ſame Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians members of both, in regard of the Relations, Rights, and Obligations, which, in the ſame perſons, remain diſtinct, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diſtinct Societies, and qualities of ſeverall perſons in the ſame. Therefore, as I ſaid in the beginning, that no Chriſtian, as a Chriſtian, can challenge any temporall Right, by his Chriſtianity, which, the State wherein he is called to be a Chriſtian, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him not: So on the other ſide, no man, by his rank in any State, is inveſted with any power, proceeding from the foundation of the Church, as it is the Church. So, that which is true in the parts, holds in the whole. The Church is indowed with no temporall Right, therefore the State is indowed with no Eccleſiaſticall Right, though it hath great Right in Eccleſiaſticall matters, of which in due time. For, all this Right, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the Church already eſtabliſhed, by that power on which it ſtandeth, and ſo, muſt maintain it, upon the ſame terms which it findeth. The homage which the Church paieth to God, for the protection of the State, is, not to betray the Right, founded on the expreſſe Charter of God, to Powers ſubſiſting by the works of his mediate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115786:27"/> But, to ſubdue ſubjects, to that obedience, for conſcience, which the State exacteth by force. For there is neceſſarily this difference, between the principles, upon which the Church and civill Communities ſubſiſt. The Charter of the one is revealed by Grace: The others ſtand upon the Laws of Nature and Nations, and acts, which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence inables men to doe, agreeable to the ſame. Therefore, as no State ſtands by the Goſpel, ſo, no right ſetled by the Goſpel, can belong to any State, or perſon, as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of any State. Beſides, Kingdomes and States have their ſeverall bounds: Many Soveraignties are contained in Chriſtendom, whereas the Church, is, by Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, one Viſible Society of all Chriſtians: Now it is manifeſt, firſt, that there are ſome things, which equally concern the whole Church, and all parts of it: Secondly, that in things which concern the whole Church, no part thereof, in any State or Kingdome, can be concluded by that State or Kingdome. Again, the Apoſtles Rule is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> VII. 24. that every man abide in the State wherein he is called to be a Chriſtian: And this proves, that no Chriſtian can challenge any temporall right by his Chriſtianity, becauſe States ſubſiſt before they are Chriſtian: Therefore it proves alſo, that no State, or
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115786:27"/> member of it, is, by being ſuch, endowed with any Right, grounded on the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church. And therefore, ſeeing the Church ſubſiſted three hundreth years before any State profeſſed Chriſtianity, whatſoever Rights it uſed, during that time, manifeſtly it ought therefore, ſtill, to uſe and enjoy: this being the moſt pertinent evidence to ſhew the bounds of it. In particular, as to the Power of the Keys, and Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, the act of it, ſeeing the intent of it is, to admit into the Viſible Society of the Church, upon preſumption, that by the right uſe of it, ſinne is taken away, and the perſon admitted to the inviſible Society of life everlaſting; and, ſeeing no Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, no quality in any, pretendeth to take away ſinne, or to judge in whom it is taken away, it followeth, that no man whatſoever, by virtue of any rank, in any State, is qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to manage this Power, or can preſume ſo to doe.</p>

                     <hi>That the whole Bodies of Chriſtians, contained in ſeverall Cities and the Territories of them, make ſeverall Churches, depending upon the Churches of greater Cities. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the People is not endowed with the Chief Power in any Church.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving ſeen thus farre, upon what Patent the community of the Church is eſtabliſhed, and the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thereof founded, it will be neceſſary far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to diſpute, in what Hands this Power is depoſited by the Apoſtles, and what perſons are truſted with it: Which point, before it be voided, we can neither determine, what Form of Government God hath ordained in his Church, nor how it may be exerciſed in Chriſtian States, without croſſing the Right which they challenge in Church mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The Presbyterians, having deſigned ſeverall Presbyteries, for the Government of ſeverall Congregations, that aſſemble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the ſervice of God, and having cried up this deſign for the Throne of Chriſt, the new Jeruſalem, and the Kingdome of God, ſeeing there is no queſtion made, that where there is a Presbytery, there is a Church, and where there is a Church, there
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115786:28"/> is the Power of the Keyes, which God hath endowed his Church with, ſeem to have given thoſe of the Congregations occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to inferre, that every Congregation, that aſſembles for the common Service of God, is, by conſequence, to have the Power of the Keys to excommunicate: whereunto ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding another principle, that the chief Power of every Congregation, is in the People, it follows, that they are all abſolute, without dependence on the reſt of the Church. But all this while, both run away with a preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, for which they can ſhew us, never a title or ſyllable of evidence in all the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. For, Presbyters and Presbyteries they may ſhew us in the Scriptures, and no grandmercy, unleſſe they can ſhew us how to underſtand them better then they doe: But, that every congregation, that aſſembles toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſerve God in common, ſhould have a company of Presbyters, for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, is a thing ſo contrary, to all the Intelligence we have, concerning the State of the Church, either under the Apoſtles themſelves, by the Scriptures, or any Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Records of the Church, or in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages of the Church, that they muſt demand of all men, to renounce common ſenſe, and all Faith, of Hiſtoricall, as well as Divine Truth, before they can beleeve it.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115786:29"/> Whereas, by the ſame evidence, by which the reſt of Chriſtianity is conveyed and commended unto us, that is, by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, interpreted by the Originall and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall practiſe of the Church, it will appear, that the Apoſtles, planting Chriſtianity, not onely in thoſe Cities, where they preached moſt, becauſe there the harveſt was greateſt, but in the Countries adjoining, which, by the cuſtome of all civile Nations every where, reſort to their Cities for Juſtice, deſigned the ſeverall Bodies of Chriſtians, that ſhould be found abiding in ſeverall Cities, and the Territories of the ſame, to make ſeverall Churches, the Government whereof they planted in thoſe Cities, both for themſelves, and for the Countries that reſorted unto them: And as, in the civile Government of all civile people, particular Cities depend upon Mother Cities, Heads of Provinces, Governments, or Soveraignties, ſo, the Churches of particular Cities, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Churches, of thoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cities, that, by the union and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence of thoſe Churches, drawing along with them, all the Churches under them, the unity of the whole Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of them all, might be eſtabliſhed, and entertained. This is the effect of that obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which I advanced in the little Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115786:29"/> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 16. that whereas it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> XIV. 23. that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas ordained Presbyters in every Church;</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that he left <hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Crete, to ordain Presbyters in every City, Tit.</hi> I. 5. and again, <hi>Acts</hi> XVI. 4. <hi>As they paſſed by the Cities, they delivered unto them the decrees determined by the Apoſtles and Presbyters at Jeruſalem. The Cities,</hi> of which he had ſaid before, that <hi>they ordained Presbyters in every Church,</hi> planted in thoſe Cities, as <hi>Titus</hi> in every City. So nice as this evidence may ſeem, to thoſe that conſider not the ſtate of the whole Church, when it ſhall appear to any man, as, to all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with their eyes open it muſt appear, that always, every where, all congregations of Chriſtians, remaining in the Country adjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to any City, made one Church, with the Chriſtians of that City; common ſenſe will inforce, that the Apoſtles deſigne was the modell, from which this form was copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, in all parts of the Church.</p>
               <p>To which purpoſe, we are to conſider in the next place, an excellent Obſervation, of that pious &amp; learned Prelate, the L. Primate of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> publiſhed in a little Diſcourſe, of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall of Biſhops, upon the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> to which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> is commanded to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect that Epiſtle, contained in the II &amp; III Chapters of the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi> The obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115786:30"/> conſiſts in this, that the ſeven Cities, wherein thoſe ſeven Churches are ſaid to be, were ſeven chief Cities, or Mother Cities, of the Province of <hi>Aſia:</hi> whereby it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that the chief Churches upon which inferiour Churches were to depend, were planted in the chief Mother Cities, to which the Countries about them reſorted for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. For certainly, no man will offer ſuch violence to his own common ſenſe, as to ſay, that there were, at the time of writing this Epiſtle, but ſeven Congregations of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in that Province, where S. <hi>Paul</hi> firſt, and after him S. <hi>John,</hi> had taken ſuch pains. And if more Congregations, but onely ſeven Churches, for what reaſon, but becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Congregations make but one Church, when they are under the City, in which that Church is planted? There hath been indeed an Objection made, from the words of this Epiſtle, when it is ſaid, at the end of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe to every particular Church, <hi>He that hath eares to hear, let him hear what the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſaith to the Churches:</hi> The addreſſe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning always thus, <hi>To the Church of Epheſus, thus ſaith the Spirit; To the Church of Smyrna thus ſaith the Spirit,</hi> and ſo of the reſt. The objection pretendeth, that by theſe words it appears, that there were, in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> for example, many Churches, conſtituting the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115786:30"/> Presbytery of that City, which is there cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Church of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> For if this were ſo, I would acknowledge that this argument were overthrown, and that Churches were not convertible with Cities, but that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Churches are here called the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> becauſe the Seat of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery was at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> according to the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Deſign. But this objection, both carries with it an anſwer to diſcover the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take upon which it is grounded, and draws after in an effectuall argument to choke the opinion which it ſupports. For, is not S. <hi>John</hi> expreſly commanded, <hi>Apoc.</hi> I. 11. to <hi>write and ſend one letter to all thoſe ſeven Churches?</hi> And can any man be ſo ſenſleſſe, as, when it is ſaid, <hi>What the Spirit ſaith to the Churches,</hi> to underſtand, ſeverall Churches, of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Smyrna,</hi> and the reſt, and not the ſeven Churches, to which the one letter is dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted? And therefore the argument ſtands good, that in theſe ſeven Cities, there were but ſeven Churches, and that the letter is directed to theſe Mother Churches, planted in the Mother Cities, becauſe inferiour Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, receiving their Chriſtianity from them, were to depend upon them, for the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of all things concerning the exerciſe of it: As the Originall and Univerſall conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and State of the Church convinces.</p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:115786:31"/>
               <p> Now the argument, which this objection and the anſwer draws after it, is this, That in all the New Teſtament, you ſhall never finde any mention of ſeverall Churches in any Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as <hi>Rome, Epheſus, Antiochia, Jeruſalem:</hi> But, when there is ſpeech of any Province, be it never ſo ſmall, you ſhall finde mention of a plurall number of Churches in it. For, of the Churches of <hi>Aſia, Syria, Cilicia, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia, Achaia, Galatia, Judaea,</hi> and <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> and of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in their diſperſions, we finde expreſſe mention upon ſeverall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, <hi>Acts</hi> IX. 31. VIII. 5, 40. XV. 41. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XVI. 1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> VIII. 2. 1 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> II. 14. <hi>Apoc.</hi> I. 11. II. 7, 11, 17, 29. III. 6, 13, 22. Though <hi>Samaria,</hi> among the reſt, were a Province of no great extent, yet, for example, you have, in that Province, the City whereof <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was, called <hi>Gittha,</hi> ſaith <hi>Epiphan. Haer.</hi> XXI. now a Village, but in thoſe days a City, ſaith he, (of which <hi>Acts</hi> VIII. 5. <hi>And Philip went down to a City of Samaria,</hi> not, <hi>the City,</hi> as we tranſlate it) and <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> which <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> ſhews us was in that Province, XXI. 7. Now tell me, what reaſon can be given for this, by any man that will pretend to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand either Scripture, or any record of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but that Churches are convertible with Cities? For had there been many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches within the City of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115786:31"/> of parallel power and privilege, making up one Claſſis, or Presbytery, or whatſoever new name can be given a new thing, without the leaſt ſyllable of example, from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to <hi>Calvin,</hi> muſt not theſe have been called the Churches, not the Church of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come now to a very expreſſe mark of this dependence, during the time, and in the actions of the Apoſtles, and therefore by their Order, acknowledged, not onely by themſelves, but by all imploied by them, in the planting of the Churches: And it is the going of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in behalf of the Churches of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> troubled by ſome, that taught at <hi>Antiochia,</hi> from whence thoſe Churches received their Chriſtianity, that Chriſtians are to keep the Law of <hi>Moſes, Acts</hi> XIII. 1. XV. 1. For, were not <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> able to reſolve this queſtion at <hi>Antiochia, Paul</hi> eſpecially, proteſting, <hi>That he received not the doctrine of the Goſpel which he preached, from man, or by man, Gal.</hi> I. 1. who is conſtrained, both to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and elſewhere, to oppoſe his calling, as a Bulwark, againſt all that labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to bring Judaiſme into the Church? Surely, in regard of the thing, they were, but in regard of authority to the Church, they were not. <hi>Barnabas</hi> was imploied by the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115786:32"/> Apoſtles to <hi>Antiochia,</hi> who found Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans there, but made them a Church, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their Aſſemblies, <hi>Acts</hi> XI. 20, 24, 25, 26. And he it was, that firſt brought <hi>Saul</hi> into that ſervice, by his authority from the Apoſtles: Though afterwards, both of them were extraordinarily imploied by the Holy Ghoſt, to preach the Goſpel, and plant Churches, <hi>Acts</hi> XIII. 1. All this while, the Church could not look upon <hi>Saul,</hi> in the quality and rank of the XII Apoſtles, which afterwards, he ſhews us, was acknowledged by the XII themſelves, at <hi>Jeruſalem, Gal.</hi> II. 8, 9. to wit, when he went to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with <hi>Barnabas</hi> about this queſtion, <hi>Acts</hi> XV. 1. for I can ſee no reaſon to doubt, that all that he ſpeaks of there, paſſed, during the time of this journey. And in the mean time, it was eaſie, for thoſe that ſtood for the Law, to pretend Revelation from God, and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the Apoſtles, in matter of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as well as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas.</hi> What poſſible way was there then, to end this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, but that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XIV. 32, 33. <hi>The ſpirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets, for God is not the God of unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but of peace, as in all Churches of the Saints?</hi> Whereupon, vindicating his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and challenging obedience to his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, even from Prophets, which might be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115786:32"/> lifted up with Revelations, to oppoſe, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>Came the word of God from you, or came it to you alone? If any man think himſelf a Prophet or ſpirituall, let him acknowledge the things that I write you, to be the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God.</hi> That is, that Apoſtles, being truſted to convey the Goſpel to the world, were to be obeyed, even by Prophets them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as the laſt reſolution of the Church, in the will of God, granting his Revelations with that temper, that, as one Prophet might ſee more, in the ſenſe, effect, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, of Revelations granted to another, then himſelf could doe, in which regard <hi>the ſpirits of the Prophets were to be ſubject to the Prophets;</hi> ſo, for the publick order of the Church, all were to have recourſe to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, whom he had truſted with it. If then, the Church of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> in which were many Prophets, and among them ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> indowed with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelations of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> XIII. 1. muſt reſort to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the ſeat of the Apoſtles, to be reſolved in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning the ſtate of the Church, how much more are we to beleeve, that God hath ordained, that dependence of Churches, without which, the Unity of no other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society can be preſerved, when he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth them not, but by humane diſcretion
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115786:33"/> of reaſonable perſons? Beſides, we are here to take notice, that the Church of <hi>Antiochia</hi> being once reſolved, the Churches of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia</hi> are reſolved by the ſame Decree, <hi>Acts</hi> XVI. 4. Becauſe, being planted from thence, they were to depend upon it, for the Rule and practice of Chriſtianity. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is both truly and pertinently obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Decree made at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was locall, and not univerſall, which, had it been made for the whole Church, there could not have been that controverſie, which we finde was at <hi>Corinth,</hi> by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> VIII. 1. about eating things offered to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols: Neither could the Apoſtle give leave to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to eat them materially, as Gods creatures, not formally, as things offered to Idols, as he does, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> VIII. 7. had the Body of the Apoſtles at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> abſolutely forbid the eating of them, to Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Chriſtians, for avoiding the ſcandall of the Jewiſh Chriſtians. But, becauſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree concerned onely the Church of <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia,</hi> and ſo by conſequence, the Churches depending upon it, therefore, among thoſe that depended not upon it, for whom the Rule was not intended, it was not to be in force.</p>
               <p>There is yet one reaſon behinde, which is the ground of all, from the Originall conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115786:33"/> of the Synagogue. <hi>Moſes,</hi> by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Jethro,</hi> ordained the Captains of Thouſands, Hundreds, Fifties, and Tens, to judge the Cauſes of the people, under him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Ex.</hi> XVIII. 24, 25. To himſelf, God joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned afterwards LXX perſons, for his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>Num.</hi> XI. 16. But theſe Captains were to be in place, but during the pilgrimage of the wilderneſſe: For, when they came to be ſetled in the land of Promiſe, the Law provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that <hi>Judges and Miniſters be ordained in every City, Deut.</hi> XVI. 18. Who, if there fell any difference about the Law, were to repair to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to the ſucceſſors of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and his Conſiſtory, for reſolution in it, <hi>Deut.</hi> XVII. 12. by which Law, whereſoever the Ark ſhould be, this Conſiſtory was to ſit, as inferiour Conſiſtories, in all inferiour Cities. Moſt men will marvell, what this is to my purpoſe, becauſe moſt men have a prejudice, that the power of the Church, is to be derived, from the Rights and Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Prieſts and Levites during the Law, though there be no reaſon for it. For theſe Rights and Privileges were not onely temporary, to vaniſh when the Goſpel was publiſhed, but alſo, while the Law ſtood, but locall, and perſonall, not extending beyond the Temple, or land of Promiſe, over any, but their own Tribe. But it is very well
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115786:34"/> known, that, from the time of the Greekiſh Empire, and partly afore it, Judaiſme ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in all parts, whereſoever the Jews were diſperſed, and that, whereſoever it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, there, were the people to be gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and regulated in the obſervation of the Law, and the publique worſhip of God, according to the ſame, frequented alſo all over the land of Promiſe, whereas the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtood but in one place. It is alſo manifeſt, that this Law, which gave the Conſiſtory power of life and death, to preſerve the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of that people in Unity, and to prevent Schiſms, upon different Interpretations of the Law, was found requiſite to be put in practice in their Diſperſions; to wit, as to the determining of all differences, ariſing out of the Law, not as to the power of life and death to inforce ſuch ſentences, this power being ſeldome granted them by their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns. For at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> we underſtand by <hi>Philo,</hi> in his Book <hi>de Legatione ad Caium,</hi> that there was ſuch a Conſiſtory, as alſo in <hi>Babylonia,</hi> there was the like, as the Jews wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings tell us; for the little Chronicle, which they call <hi>Seder Olam Zuta,</hi> gives us the names of the Heads thereof, for many ages. And after the deſtruction of the Temple, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, not onely by their writings, as <hi>Semach David, Sepher Juchaſin,</hi> and the like: but
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115786:34"/> by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> in the Hereſie of the Ebio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, and the Conſtitutions of the Emperors remaining in the Codes, <hi>Tit. de Judaeis &amp; Coelicolis,</hi> that there continued a Conſiſtory at <hi>Tiberias,</hi> for many ages, the Heads where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were of the family of <hi>David,</hi> as <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> agreeing with the Jews, informeth us, in the place aforenamed; And as, by the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Saul</hi> in the <hi>Acts,</hi> it appears, that the Jews of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> were ſubject to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> ſo by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> in the Hereſie of the Ebionites, it appears, that the Synagogues of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> were ſubject to the Conſiſtory at <hi>Tiberias,</hi> as I have ſhewed out of <hi>Benjamins Itinerary,</hi> in the Diſcourſe of the Apoſtolicall form of Divine Service, <hi>p.</hi> 67. that the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues of the parts of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and <hi>Media,</hi> were, to that in <hi>Bagdat,</hi> and without doubt, that great Body of Jews, diſperſed through Aegypt, was, to that at <hi>Alexandria.</hi> As for the Law of <hi>Deut.</hi> XVII. 18. the Jews need not tell us, as they doe, <hi>Maimoni</hi> by name, <hi>Tit. de Syncdrio,</hi> that they were not bound to obſerve that, in their diſperſions, for how could there be Conſiſtories for the Jews, in all Cities, all over the world? but this they tell us, withall, in particular <hi>Arba Thurim</hi> in the ſame title <hi>Sub init.</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, they hold themſelves bound, to erect
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115786:35"/> Conſiſtories in the chief Cities of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions. In this condition, what is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, between the ſtate of the Synagogue and the Church, ſetting aſide that eſſentiall difference, between the Law and the Goſpel, by which, Judaiſm was confined to one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but Chriſtianity had a promiſe to be received by the Gentiles? By reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Law ceaſed, as it was proper to the Jews, and Chriſtians became obliged, only to the perpetual Law of God, beſides a very few poſitive precepts of our Lord, as of Baptiſm, &amp; the Euchariſt, and the Power of the Keys, by virtue whereof, and by the generall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Apoſtles, all Ordinances, whereby they ſhould regulate the Society of the Church, were to be received, as the Commandements of God. Here is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for which it is probable, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, in deſigning the Government of the Church, ſhould follow no other pattern, then that which they ſaw in uſe, by the Law, in the Synagogue. For, the deſign in both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to maintain the Law of God, and the unity of his people, in his ſervice, ſaving the difference between them; what form ſhould they follow, but that, which the Law had taught their Fore-fathers? But, when the effect hereof appears, in the firſt lines of this modell, traced by the Apoſtles, and filled up
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115786:35"/> by their Succeſſors, it is manifeſt, that theſe Laws were the pattern, but the Order of the Apoſtles, the Act, which put it in being and force. The Churches of <hi>Jeruſalem, Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia, Rome,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> no man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, were planted by the Apoſtles, in perſon, and by their Deputies. That they became afterwards Heads of the Churches that lay about them, is no more then that, which the Conſiſtories, planted at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias,</hi> and in the chief Cities of the Jews diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions, were, to the Synagogues under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them, by virtue of the Law. This is therefore the Originall, of the dependence of Churches, upon the greateſt Mother Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. And therefore it is no marvell, that <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> once the Mother City of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, became afterwards, the ſeat of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch indeed, in remembrance of that privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, but inferiour in dignity, and nothing comparable in bounds to the reſt, becauſe it was none of the greateſt and moſt Capitall Cities: The Rule of the Apoſtles deſign be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, that the greateſt Cities ſhould be the Seats of the greateſt Churches. And that <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> when it came afterwards to be a Seat of the Empire, was put in the next place to the Chief; as it was no act of the Apoſtles, ſo it is an argument of the Rule, by which the reſt had been ordered,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115786:36"/> for the ſame reaſon. As for the other Law of <hi>Deu.</hi> XVI. 18. I know not what could be more agreeable to it, then that Rule of the ancient Church, which is to be ſeen, not only in thoſe few ancient Canons, alledged in the diſcourſe of the Primitive Government of Churches, <hi>p.</hi> 67. but in innumerable paſſages of Church Writers, that Cathedrall Churches and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be convertible, that is, both of the ſame extent. Thus the Epiſtle of <hi>Ignatius</hi> to the Romanes, is inſcribed, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The preſidence here expreſſed, argueth the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of that Church, above the reſt of the Churches about it. But <hi>Clemens,</hi> directeth his Epiſtle, from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to that of <hi>Corinth,</hi> thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, whereby we underſtand, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try lying under the City, belonged to the Church founded in the City, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſignifying that, which we now call the Dioceſe, in oppoſition to the Mother Church That this is the reaſon of the name <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, appears, becauſe <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp</hi> addreſſes his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> in this ſtyle, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For, if the Church of the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> dwelt near <hi>Philippi,</hi> then the Country ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining, belonged to the Church of that City.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115786:36"/> This reaſon therefore, was well underſtood by him that writ the Epiſtle to the Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians, in <hi>Ignatius</hi> his name, granting it to be of an age much inferiour to his: For he inſcribeth it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: Signifying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that all the Chriſtians of <hi>Syria,</hi> belonged to the Church of <hi>Antiochia;</hi> for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Ignatius</hi> himſelf, in his Epiſtle to the Romanes, calls himſelf Biſhop of <hi>Syria,</hi> not of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> becauſe being Biſhop of the Head City Church, the Chriſtians of <hi>Syria,</hi> either belonged to his Church, or to the Churches that were under it. A thing ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be beleeved, that there are many marks in his Epiſtles, to ſhew, that the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches alſo of <hi>Cilicia</hi> belonged to his charge, as we ſaw they did by their foundation in the Apoſtles time, and as the reaſon of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Government required, thoſe parts where <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> firſt preached, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued longeſt in the Dominion of the Kings of <hi>Syria,</hi> and therefore continuing under the Government that reſided at <hi>Antiochia.</hi> And thus are the words of <hi>Clemens,</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> fulfilled, where he ſaith, that the Apoſtles, having preached the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel in Cities and Countries, conſtituted Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Miniſters of thoſe that ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; to wit, according to the Cities and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115786:37"/> Countries adjoining to them. Thoſe marks, come from the ancienteſt Records the Church hath, after the writings of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: Of the reſt there would be no end, if a man would allege them.</p>
               <p>If any man object, that it cannot be made to appear, how this Rule was ever obſerved in the Church, the extent of Cathedrall Churches, being in ſome Countries ſo ſtrait, in other ſo large: The anſwer is, that it cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not to be a Rule, though the execution of it was very different in ſeverall Countries, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe not underſtood ſo well as it ſhould have been, or becauſe the condition of ſome Countries was not appliable to it, ſo as that of others. For the Eaſt, we have theſe words of <hi>Walafridus Strabo, libs de Rebus Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticis: Fertur in Orientis partibus per ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulas Vrbes &amp; Praefecturas ſingulas eſſe Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcoporum gubernationes:</hi> Whereby we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that Cathedrall Churches ſtood very much thicker in the Eaſtern parts, then in the Weſt: For thereupon it became ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable to <hi>Walafridus.</hi> In <hi>Africk,</hi> if we look but into the writings of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> we ſhall finde hundreds of Biſhops reſorting to one Councell. In <hi>Ireland</hi> alone, S. <hi>Patrick</hi> is ſaid by <hi>Ninius,</hi> at the firſt plantation of Chriſtianity, to have founded three hundreth threeſcore and five Biſhopricks.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115786:37"/> On the other ſide, in <hi>England,</hi> we ſee ſtill, how many Counties remain in one Dioceſe of <hi>Lincoln;</hi> and yet if we look into <hi>Almain,</hi> and thoſe mighty foundations of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, we may finde perhaps larger then it. The Rule, notwithſtanding all this, is the ſame, that Cathedrall Churches be founded in Cities, though Cities are diverſly recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſeverall Countries, nay, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome Countries where the Goſpel comes, have ſcarce any thing worth the name of Cities: Where, the Rule muſt be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, according to the diſcretion of men that have it in hand, and the condition of times. This we may generally obſerve, that Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were erected in greater number, when they were erected without indowment, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by temporall Law: So that, in one of the Africane Canons, it is queſtionable, whether a Biſhop have many Presbyters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him: Fewer ſtill, where they were foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Princes profeſſing Chriſtianity, upon temporall endowments. And upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, it will be no prejudice to this Rule, that in Aegypt, till the time of <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> there was no Cathedrall Church, but that of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> If it be fit to beleeve the late Antiquities of that Church, publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed out of <hi>Eutychius,</hi> becauſe they ſeem to agree with that which S. <hi>Hierome</hi> reporteth
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115786:38"/> of that Church. As, to this day, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Jeſuites, whoſe relation you may ſee in <hi>Godignus, de Rebus Abaſsinorum,</hi> I. 32. there is but one for all <hi>Preſter Johns</hi> Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the County of the <hi>Abaſſines.</hi> For, though men would not, or could not execute the Rule, ſo, as it took place in more civile Countries, yet, that ſuch a Rule there was, is eaſie to beleeve, when we ſee Chriſtianity ſuffer as it does, in thoſe Countries profeſſing Chriſt, by the neglect of it.</p>
               <p>Before I leave this point, I will touch one argument to the whole queſtion, drawn from common ſenſe, preſuppoſing Hiſtoricall truth. For they that place the chief power in Congregations, or require at all ſeverall Presbyteries, for the government of ſeverall Congregations, are bound at leaſt to ſhew us, that Congregations were diſtinguiſhed in the times of the Apoſtles, if they will entitle their deſign to them. Which I utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny that they were. I doe beleeve, the Presbyterians have convinced thoſe of the Congregations, that in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> time, the Churches to whom he writes, contained ſuch numbers, as could by no means aſſemble at once: But ſeverall Churches they could not make, being not diſtinguiſhed into ſeverall Congregations, but meeting together from time to time, according to opportunity and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115786:38"/> order given. About S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, and not afore, I finde mention of Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſetled in the Country: For in his XXVIII Epiſtle, you have mention of one <hi>Gaius Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter Diddenſis,</hi> which was the name of ſome place near <hi>Carthage,</hi> the Church whereof was under the cure of this <hi>Gaius;</hi> and in the life of Pope <hi>Dionyſius</hi> about this time, it is ſaid, that he divided the Dioceſes into Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> againſt the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees, ſpeaking of the beginning of them under <hi>Probus,</hi> about this time, there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one <hi>Trypho</hi> Presbyter of <hi>Diodoris,</hi> a Village, as it ſeems, by his relation there) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Archelaus,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Caſchara</hi> in <hi>Meſopotamia;</hi> Likewiſe, in an Epiſtle of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onyſius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> reported by <hi>Euſebius, Eccleſ. Hiſt.</hi> VII. 24. there is mention of the <hi>Presbyters and Teachers of the brethren in the Villages.</hi> And thoſe Churches of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try called <hi>Mareotes,</hi> hard by <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which <hi>Socrates, Eccleſ. Hiſt.</hi> I. 27. ſaith, were Pariſhes of the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> muſt needs be thought to have been eſtabliſhed, long before that time whereof he writes there. After this, in the Canons of <hi>Ancyra</hi> and <hi>Neocaeſarea,</hi> and thoſe writings that follow, there is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times difference made, between City and country Presbyters. In Cities, this muſt needs
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115786:39"/> have been begun long afore, as we find men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the life of Pope <hi>Cains,</hi> where it is ſaid, that he divided the Titles and Coemiteries among the Presbyters: and the diſtribution of the Wards of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> and the Churches of them, mentioned by <hi>Epiphanius, Haer.</hi> LXVIII. <hi>&amp;</hi> LXIX. ſeems to have been made, long before the time whereof he ſpeaks. But, when <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſays expreſly, <hi>Apol.</hi> II. that, in his time, thoſe out of the Country, and thoſe in the City, aſſembled in one, farre was it from diſtinguiſhing ſetled Congregations under the Apoſtles. Which if it be true, the poſition which I have hitherto proved, muſt needs be admitted, that the Chriſtians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in ſeverall Cities, and the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of them, were by the Apoſtles ordered, to be divided into ſeverall diſtinct Bodies and Societies, which the Scripture calls Churches, and are now known by the name of Cathedrall Churches, and the Dioceſes of them, conſtituting one whole Church.</p>
               <p>This being proved, I ſhall not much thank any man, to quit me the Poſition, upon which the Congregations are grounded, to wit, the chiefe Power of the people in the Church: Though, it ſeems, they are not yet agreed themſelves, what the Power of the people ſhould be. <hi>Morellus,</hi> in the French
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115786:39"/> Churches, diſputed downright, that the State of Government in the Church, ought to be democratick, the people to be Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign: Wherein, by <hi>Bezaes</hi> Epiſtles it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that he was ſupported by <hi>Ramus:</hi> For the man, whom <hi>Beza</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and deſcribes by other circumlocutions, who put the French Churches to the trouble of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Synods, to ſuppreſſe this Poſition, as there it appears, can be no other then <hi>Ramus.</hi> Perhaps, <hi>Ramus</hi> his credit in our Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, was the firſt means, to bring this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in Religion among us: For, about the time that he was moſt cried up in them, <hi>Brown</hi> and <hi>Barow</hi> publiſhed it. Unleſſe it be more probable, to fetch it from the troubles of <hi>Francford.</hi> For, thoſe that would take upon them, to exerciſe the Power of the Keys in that eſtate, becauſe they were a Congregation, that aſſembled together for the Service of God, which power could not ſtand, unleſſe recourſe might be had to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, did, by expreſſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, challenge the publick power of the Church, to all Congregations; which I have ſhewed to be otherwiſe. And, the conteſt there related, between one of the people, and one of the Paſtors, ſhews, that they groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelves upon the Right of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. So true it is, that I ſaid afore, that the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115786:40"/> Presbyterians, have ſtill held the ſtirrup to thoſe of the Congregations, to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of the ſaddle. As now the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Congregations is refined, they will not have it ſaid, that they make the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple chief in the Church: For, they give them power, which they will have ſubject to that Authority, which they place in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors &amp; Elders; which ſerves not the turn. We have an inſtance againſt it in the State of <hi>Rome,</hi> after they had driven away the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins.</hi> They placed Authority in the Senate, and Power in the People: and, I ſuppoſe, the ſucceſſe of time ſhewed, that which <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> diſputes againſt <hi>Polybius, De Repub.</hi> II. 2. to be moſt true, that the State was thereby made a Democraty. So, the Congregations challenging to themſelves Right, to make themſelves Churches, and by conſequence, whom they pleaſe Paſtors, muſt needs, by conſequence, reduce the Authority they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, to what meaſure the people ſhall pleaſe, whom, by their proceedings, they inable, to make and unmake, members and Paſtors at their pleaſure. But I diſpute not the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their deſign, before they declare, what they are agreed upon in it. Beſides, they conceive they have this Right in the Church, becauſe they are Saints: as Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts conceive, that, by the ſame title, they
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115786:40"/> have Right to the Goods of this world, and, as Chriſtians conceive, they have thoſe Rights, which they pretend to, in the Viſible Church, by lawfull Ordination and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: And, that they are Saints, they ſeem to preſume upon this ground, that they have been admitted to ſuch a Congregation, upon Covenant, to live in ſuch Society, for which they ſeparate from the Church. It ſhall be enough, to levell the grounds and reaſons from Scripture, upon which, they have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Church, under pretence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the freedom of Saints, before they are agreed, wherein this freedom conſiſts, and how far it extends. And truly, that which I have hitherto proved, ſeems to be a peremptory preſcription againſt their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. For, if the Apoſtles ordered the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of ſeverall Churches, to conſiſt of the whole numbers of Chriſtians, contained in ſeverall Cities, and in the Territories of them, which, no common ſenſe can poſſibly imagine, that they could aſſemble all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at any time, for the ſervice of God: it follows of neceſſity, that the power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning thoſe Churches, was not depoſited, by the Apoſtles, in the Body of the People, whereof thoſe Churches did or ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. For, where the Power is in the People, there the whole Body of the People, muſt
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115786:41"/> have means to Aſſemble, to take Order in ſuch things, as concern the ſtate of it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Aſſemblies of the Church being only for Divine Service, and, at thoſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, it being impoſſible that all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of thoſe Churches ſhould meet, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe muſt pronounce, that, the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of taking Order in the common affairs of Churches, is not depoſited by the Apoſtles, in the Body of the People.</p>
               <p>Another exception there is, to all, or moſt of the particulars, which they alledge out of the ſcriptures, far more peremptory then his. For, thoſe things, upon which they ground the right &amp; intereſs of the people in the Church, were done under the Apoſtles, that is, not only in their time, but alſo, in concurrence, with their Right and Power in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church. So that, if we beleeve, or if we prove, the chief Power to have been then in the Apoſtles, it cannot, by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures which they produce, be proved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the People, becauſe their evidence cannot prove, any greater Power, or Right, to be now in the People, then belonged to them, when the Scriptures they allege, were ſaid, or done, under the Apoſtles. Now, I ſuppoſe, I ſhall not need to intreat any man to grant me, that the Soveraign Power of the Church, was then in the Apoſtles, which
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115786:41"/> their Commiſſion will eaſily evince. The name of an Apoſtle, ſeemeth to have been borrowed, by our Lord, from the ordinary uſe of that people. For, in their Law, it ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſignifieth, a mans Proxy, or Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, deputed to ſome purpoſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the ſignification of it in the Scriptures, is very large: So that, when we reade of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paphroditus, Apoſtle of the Philippians, Phil.</hi> II. 25, 30. or of <hi>Luke,</hi> and <hi>Titus, Apoſtles of the Churches,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> VIII. 19, 20, 23. we are not to conceive, by this name, any thing like the Office of the Apoſtles of Chriſt: For theſe later are plainly called Apoſtles of the Churches, as deputed by them, to carry their Contributions to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> And <hi>Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus</hi> of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> as imploied by them, to wait upon, and furniſh S. <hi>Paul</hi> with his neceſſary charges at <hi>Rome.</hi> The power of Chriſts Apoſtles, then, muſt not be valued by the name of Apoſtle, nor by the perſon of our Lord Chriſt that ſends them, for he might have ſent other manner of men, upon inferiour errands, and all been Apoſtles: But by the work, which they are truſted with, expreſſed in their Commiſſion, <hi>As my Father ſent me—Whoſe ſoever ſins ye remit—</hi>and <hi>Goe preach and teach all Nations—</hi>For if God ordain his Church, to be one Viſible Society, to ſerve him in the Profeſſion of the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115786:42"/> Goſpel, and truſt onely his Apoſtles, and the Church, with the Power of the Keys, the root of all Eccleſiaſticall Power, as hath been ſaid: either the Church muſt challenge it, againſt the Apoſtles, which is not but by them, or it muſt be underſtood, to have been then in the Church, becauſe it was in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, in whom it was before the Church, which was founded by them; whereupon, the Office of the Apoſtles, is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Biſhoprick, before the Church was, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they were Biſhops, to wit, in <hi>Judas, Acts</hi> I. 9. A meaning eaſie to be read in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them: For, the Church being the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall <hi>Iſrael;</hi> as <hi>Iſrael</hi> according to the fleſh, coming of XII Patriarchs, had always XII Princes of their Tribes, and LXX Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, members of the great Conſiſtory, to govern them in the greateſt matters, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the State of the whole People, under one King, or Judge, or under God, when they had neither King nor Judge: So did our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour appoint XII Patriarchs, as it were, of his ſpirituall People, LXX Governours of another Rank, both under the name of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, in whom ſhould reſt, the whole Power of governing that People, whereof him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in heaven, remains always King.</p>
               <p>A perfect evidence hereof, is the deriving of other Power from them, as theirs is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115786:42"/> from Chriſt. We reade in the Scriptures of Euangeliſts, and we reade of another ſort of Apoſtles, which, if we underſtand not to be of the number of the LXX, we muſt needs conceive, to be ſo called, becauſe they were Apoſtles of the Apoſtles, that is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſent by the XII Apoſtles, to aſſiſt them, in the work committed to their truſt, which, it is plain, could not be executed by them in perſon alone. And indeed, thoſe whom the Scripture cals <hi>falſe Apoſtles,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> XI. 13. and, <hi>that ſaid they were Apoſtles and were not, Apoc.</hi> II. 2. what can we imagine they were, but ſuch as pretended to be imploied by other Apoſtles, (perhaps by S. <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> who had a hand in the founding of that Church, as we learn by <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> in <hi>Euſebius, Eccleſ. Hiſtor.</hi> II. 25. agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the beginning of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) but intended indeed, under their names and authorities, to pull down that, which was built by their fellow Apoſtles. And in this ſenſe, perhaps, S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Andronicus</hi> and <hi>Junias</hi> eminent among the Apoſtles, <hi>Rom.</hi> XVI. 7. becauſe, it may be, they were imploied by himſelf, or by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> about the Goſpel, at <hi>Rome.</hi> And hereby, we may take meaſure what Euangeliſts were. For, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it appears by the Scripture, that they were the Apoſtles Scholars, deputed by
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115786:43"/> them, and limited to ſuch imploiment, as they found moſt proper for their aſſiſtance; it is manifeſt, that they could have no authority, but derived from the Apoſtles. A thing, perfectly agreeing with the Cuſtome, that had always been among Gods People. For, all Prophets, whom God imploied upon his meſſages, and may therefore properly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Apoſtles, (as our Lord Chriſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Apoſtle of our Profeſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> III. 1) had their Diſciples to wait upon them, which is called <hi>miniſtring to them</hi> in the language of the Scripture. Thus <hi>Joſhua, the Miniſter of Moſes, Exod.</hi> XXIV. 13. <hi>Elizeus poured wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on the hands of Elias,</hi> as the Chief of his Scholars, that expected a double portion of his ſpirit, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> II. 9. III. 11. Thus the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>he is not worthy to looſe, or take away our Saviours ſhooes, Mat.</hi> III. 11. <hi>Mar.</hi> I. 7. that is, to be his Diſciple; for, by <hi>Maimoni,</hi> in the Title of learning the Law, <hi>cap.</hi> V. we learn, that the Diſciples of the Jews Doctors, were to do that ſervice for their Maſters. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Luc.</hi> XXII. 26. <hi>I am among you as he that miniſtreth:</hi> to wit, not as a Maſter, but as a Diſciple. Thus, the chief of our Lords Diſciples, whom he had choſen, from the beginning, to be with him, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Commiſſion, became his Apoſtles, having waited on his Perſon, and, by fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115786:43"/> converſation, learned his doctrine, better then others; Whereupon I ſaid, in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Government of Churches <hi>p.</hi> 3. that, to make an Apoſtle, it was requiſite to have ſeen our Lord in the fleſh, and, that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to S. <hi>Paul</hi> after death, to advance him to that rank, by this privilege, <hi>Mar.</hi> III. 14. <hi>Mat.</hi> X. 1, 4. And ſhall we think, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did not, as their Lord, and all the Prophets before him had done, chooſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Scholars, that, by waiting on them, might learn their Doctrine, and become fit, to be imploied under them, and after them? If we do, we ſhall miſ-kenne the moſt remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable circumſtances of Scripture: For we may eaſily obſerve, that thoſe, who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Scriptures Euangeliſts, are ſuch, as firſt waited upon the Apoſtles, as S. <hi>Mark</hi> upon S. <hi>Peter, Timothy</hi> and S. <hi>Luke</hi> upon S. <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> XVI. 1. XIX. 22. as <hi>Mark</hi> upon <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Acts</hi> XIII. 5. and <hi>Mark</hi> again, (whether the ſame or another) upon S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> IV. 11. And therefore, I eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grant, both <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to have been Euangeliſts, though the Scripture ſays it but of one, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> IV. 5. becauſe I ſee them both Companions of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that is, his Scholars and Miniſters: And therefore, find it very reaſonable, that he ſhould imploy <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> to Preach the Goſpel in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115786:44"/> thoſe parts, where himſelf had left, hoping to goe further, and carry it beyond, into <hi>Illy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricum,</hi> whereof <hi>Dalmatia</hi> was a part, as you may ſee, by comparing the Scriptures, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> IV. 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> XV. 19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> X 16. <hi>Tit.</hi> III. 12. For, thus alſo, of the ſeven Miniſters to the Apoſtles at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> you ſee <hi>Steven</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> imploied in Preaching the Goſpel, and this later called therefore expreſly an Euangeliſt, <hi>Acts</hi> VI. 9. VIII. 5, 12. XXI. 8. And therefore, it is not poſſible, for any man, out of the Scriptures, to diſtinguiſh between the Office of Euangeliſts, and thoſe whom I ſhewed to have been Apoſtles of the Apoſtles: And thereby, the concluſion remains firm, that all Eccleſiaſticall Power, at that time remained, and, for future times, is to be derived from the Apoſtles, when we ſee by the Scriptures, that the Euangeliſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived their Office and Authority from their appointment. And indeed, how can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe indure to apprehend it otherwiſe, eſpecially, admitting, that which hath been diſcourſed, of the Power of the Keys, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting into the Church? That being made Chriſtians by the Apoſtles, becauſe, by them convinced to beleeve, that they were Gods Meſſengers, whom they ſtood bound to obey, ſhould nevertheleſſe, by being Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtains, obtain the Power, of regulating and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115786:44"/> concluding the Apoſtles themſelves, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning the Community of the Church, (which, what it meant, or, that ſuch a Society ſhould be, they could not ſo much as imagine, but by them,) is a thing, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe can admit without prejudice. Thoſe that purchaſe dominion by lawfull Conqueſt in the world, become thereby, able to diſpoſe of all their Subjects have, becauſe they give them their lives, that is, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The Church is a People, ſubdued to Chriſt, by the Apoſtles, not by force, but by the ſword of the Spirit, and though to free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yet, that freedome conſiſts, in the ſtate of particular Chriſtians towards God, not in the publique Power of the Church, otherwiſe then it is conveyed lawfully, from them that had it before the Church. Indeed, viſible Chriſtianity, is a condition requiſite to make a man capable of Eccleſiaſticall Power, and the Church is then in beſt eſtate, when that legall preſumption of inviſible Chriſtianity, is moſt reaſonable: But, if Saints, becauſe Saints, have Power and Right to govern the Church, then follows the Poſition, impoſed on <hi>Wicleffe</hi> and <hi>Huſſe</hi> in the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and condemned by all Chriſtians, that Eccleſiaſticall Power holds and fails with Grace; which will not fail, to draw after it, the like conſequence in
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115786:45"/> Secular matters, pernicious to all Civile So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, that the intereſſe of honeſt men is the intereſſe of Kingdomes and States, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting the principle laid down at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, that Chriſtianity calls no man to any advantage of this world, but to the Croſſe. Therefore no Chriſtian, or Saint, as Saint, or Chriſtian, hath any Right or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Church, but that which can be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully derived from the Order of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Thoſe of the Congregations, uſe to allege S. <hi>Peters</hi> apology to the Jewiſh Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, for converſing with <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Company, <hi>Acts</hi> XI. 9. as alſo that of S. <hi>Paul, Col.</hi> IV. 17. ſpeaking to the body of the Church at <hi>Coloſſae, Say to Archippus, look to the Miniſtery which thou haſt received to fulfill it;</hi> as if S. <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Archippus,</hi> muſt be afraid of Excommunication, if they render not a good account of their actions to the People. By which it may appear, how truly I have ſaid, that the Power, they give the People, is in check to that Power, which was exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Apoſtles. But if we reaſon not amiſſe, it would be a great prejudice to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> could not inform Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian People, of the reaſon of his doings, which they underſtood not, but he muſt make them his Soveraign. Or that S. <hi>Paul,</hi> conveying his commands to <hi>Archippus,</hi> by
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:115786:45"/> an Epiſtle directed to the whole Church, ſhould be thought to inveſt the People, in that Power, by which he commands <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chippus.</hi> They allege alſo, the People of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> preſent at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell there, and joyned in the letter, by which the decree is ſignified and conveyed to the Churches of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia, Acts</hi> XV. 4, 12, 23. But of this I have ſpoken already, and am very willing, to leave all men to judge by the premiſes, whether it is probable, that for reſolution in a doubt, which ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> could not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, as to the Body of the Church, it can be thought, that they reſorted to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as to the Brethren, or as to the Apoſtles: whether it can be imagined, that the People of the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> could preſcribe, in any way, either of Power, or of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or Illumination, unto the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and the publique perſons of it: Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether the arrow is not ſhot beyond the mark, when it is argued, that this Decree is the act of the People, becauſe it appears that they aſſent to it, ſeeing we know by the premiſes, that they were bound to conſent to the Acts of the Apoſtles. So, in the Power of the Keys, and Excommunication, what can be ſo plain, as, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives ſentence upon the inceſtuous perſon at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115786:46"/> obliges the Church there, to execute his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, as he calls it in expreſſe terms, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> V. 3, 4? I conceive, I have read an anſwer to this, in ſome of their writings, that this Epiſtle is Scripture, and therefore, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it commanded by God. But let me inſtance in the reſult of the Councell at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem:</hi> The Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by virtue of the Decree, for to them there was no Epiſtle ſent: Therefore the Church of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> and the reſt of the Churches to whom that Epiſtle was ſent, which we have, <hi>Acts</hi> XV 23. were tied, by virtue of the Decree, not by virtue of the Epiſtle, by which they knew themſelves tied. And let me put the caſe here: Had S. <hi>Paul</hi> been at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and decreed that, which he decreeth by this Epiſtle, had not the Church been tied, unleſſe he had ſent them an Epiſtle, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe made it appear to them, that he had a Revelation from God on purpoſe, having made appearance to them, that he was the Apoſtle of Chriſt? Beleeve himſelf in that caſe, when he ſays, he will doe as much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as preſent, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> XI. 11. And again, <hi>When I come I ſhall bewail divers,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> XII. 20, 21. that is, excommunicate them, or put them to Penance, as I have ſaid. Remember the miraculous effect of Excommunication in the Apoſtles time, when, by viſible puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115786:46"/> inflicted on the excommunicate by evil Angels, it appeared, that they were caſt out of the ſhadow of Gods Tabernacle, and it will ſeem as probable, that this is the Rod, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> threatens the <hi>Corinthians</hi> with, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> IV. 21. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> X. 2, 8. as, <hi>that many were ſick there,</hi> becauſe they abuſed the Euchariſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XI. 30. Therefore, if this effect of the ſentence, came from the Apoſtles, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence alſo came. Here appears a neceſſary ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, from the Legiſlative Power of the Apoſtles, to the whole Church. For, as no Chriſtian can deny, that the Conſtitutions of the Apoſtles oblige the Church, ſo it is manifeſt, that they doe not oblige it, becauſe they are written in the Scripture, for, they were all in force in the Church, before the Scriptures were written, in which they are related; neither doth it evidence, that they were firſt delivered to the Church, with aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that they were, by expreſſe Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, commanded to be delivered to the Church, or, becauſe they were paſſed by votes of the People: But by virtue of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Commiſſion of the Apoſtles, being received, in that quality, by thoſe that became Chriſtians, and ſo made a Church. So, in matter of Ordinations, it is well known, who they are, that have made the People beleeve, that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> Ordained Presbyters,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115786:47"/> in the Churches of their founding, by voices of the People, ſignified by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Acts</hi> XIV. 22. which being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is but an eaſie conſequence to inferre, that all Congregations are abſolute, becauſe, making their Presbyters, they muſt needs firſt make themſelves Churches. But he that reads the Text without prejudice, eaſily ſees, that the Act of Ordaining, is here attributed to the Apoſtles, not to the People. <hi>They,</hi> the Apoſtles, <hi>ordained them,</hi> to wit, the Church or People, <hi>Presbyters:</hi> Therefore, this Scripture, ſpeaks not of Election, by Holding up of the Peoples hands, but of Ordination, by laying on the Hands of the Apoſtles. And therefore, in the choice of the ſeven Deacons, it is manifeſt, that the Apoſtles, though they gave way to the People to nominate, yet reſerved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the approving of the perſons, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the People might have ſinned, and the Apoſtles born the blame for it. For, when S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lay Hands ſuddenly on no man, nor participate of other mens ſins,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> V. 22. it is manifeſt, that he who Impoſes Hands, ought to have power not to Impoſe, becauſe he ſins Impoſing amiſſe. Laſt of all, let us conſider, how liberally the Church of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> parted with whole eſtates; the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> maintained their Feaſts
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115786:47"/> of Love, wherof we reade, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XI. 17. the ſame <hi>Corinthians</hi> with other Churches, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the ſupport of the Churches in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> VIII. 1—the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſent to ſupply S. <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> II 25. 30. IV. 20. And all the reſt which we finde recorded in the New Teſtament, of the Oblations of the Faithfull to the maintenance of Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: Whence, it ſhall appear in due time, that the Indowment of the Church is eſtated upon it: And then, let common ſenſe judge, whether this came from the underſtanding, and motion, and proper devotion of the People, or from their Chriſtianity, obliging them to follow that Order, which the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and doctrine of the Apoſtles, ſhould ſhew them to be requiſite, for their Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the ſupport of the Church at that time.</p>
               <p>By all this, as it will eaſily appear, that the Chief Intereſſe and Right in diſpoſing of Church matters, could not belong to the People, under the Apoſtles, ſo is it not my purpoſe to ſay, that, at any time, the People ought to have no manner of Right or Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe in the ſame. For, if the practice under the Apoſtles, be the beſt evidence, that we can ground Law upon to the Church, then it is requiſite, to the good eſtate of the Church, and neceſſary, for thoſe, that can
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115786:48"/> diſpoſe of the publique Order of it, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, that it be ſuch, as may give the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reaſonable ſatisfaction, in thoſe things wherein they are concerned: Which, what it requires, and how farre it extends, I will ſay ſomewhat in generall, when we come to give bounds, to the ſeverall Intereſts, in the publique Power of the Church. In the mean time, as no water can aſcend higher, then it deſcended afore, ſo can no People have any further Right and Power in Church matters, then that which the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had under the Apoſtles, becauſe that is all the evidence upon which their Intereſſe can be grounded and acknowledged. Leſſe is not to be granted, more they muſt not require.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THeſe things premiſed, I ſhall here ſuppoſe, that the reaſons heretofore advanced, are ſufficient to prove, that, by Ordinance of the Apoſtles, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of every ſuch Church, conſiſting of the Body of Chriſtians, in a City and the Territory thereof, is to reſt in a Biſhop, and a Company or College of Presbyters, his Counſell and Aſſiſtants in the exerciſe of the Chief Power thereof, to whom are added the Deacons, to attend them in executing their commands: Adding onely for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, in confirmation of thoſe reaſons, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that there is an ordinary Power, of Governing Churches of their own planting, in the Apoſtles, eaſily to be diſtinguiſhed, from the power of other Apoſtles, becauſe, whereas, the generall Commiſſion, extends
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115786:49"/> the power of every Apoſtle to the whole Church; thoſe things which we finde recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, either in the Scriptures, or in other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of Hiſtoricall truth, which common ſenſe cannot refuſe to credit, do ſhew manifeſt arguments, of the ſpeciall exerciſe thereof, <hi>de facto,</hi> in ſpeciall places, either by contract, when a Chriſtian may think, that an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be requiſite, among ſuch holy perſons, as we ſee, <hi>Gal.</hi> II. 9. Or otherwiſe, by occupation, and uſe. And this ordinary Power of the Apoſtles, is as eaſie to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the Power of Biſhops, by the extent of it, this of Biſhops reaching onely to the Church whereof they are made Biſhops.</p>
               <p>Now, to make good the proof, that <hi>Iames</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was one of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, I muſt here anſwer two queſtions, which ſeem to make this opinion hard to beleeve. The firſt, becauſe <hi>Hegeſippus</hi> in <hi>Euſebius,</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes mentioning <hi>Simeon</hi> the ſon of <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas,</hi> and that he ſucceeded this <hi>James</hi> in the Government of that Church, never mentions in one ſyllable, any relation of his to this <hi>James</hi> whom he ſucceeded; which, if they had been ſo near as brothers, it ſeems he would have done.

               <p>Now, whereas it is ſaid, that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had that power which the Scripture witneſſeth, as Evangeliſts, it is to be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, by what Scripture it can appear, that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, as Evangeliſts, had any Power in any Church? That they were near in rank and eſteem to the Apoſtles, I grant, becauſe of the Scriptures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XII. 28. <hi>Eph.</hi> IV. 12. that <hi>Titus</hi> was an Evangeliſt, as well as <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> IV. 5.

But having ſhewed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115786:51"/> ſuch probabilities, to think, that Evangeliſts were no more then a ſecondary rank of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, that is, men imploied by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles upon any work; it cannot be ſaid, that, by the quality of Evangeliſts, they had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to govern any Church, unleſſe it can be ſhewed, that the work on which they were imploied, was the governing of ſetled Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Which cannot be ſhewed, of any but <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> by the Epiſtles to them; which ſhew, that they two were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in that quality, at <hi>Epheſus</hi> and in <hi>Crete.</hi> For <hi>Epaphras,</hi> that is, <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> (for the names are both one) that was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied by the <hi>Philippians</hi> to S. <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> II. 25, 30. was alſo imploied, (no doubt by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> or by ſome other of the Apoſtles, unleſſe we will ſay that he depended not on them, contrary to that which hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) to Preach the Goſpel to the <hi>Coloſsians,</hi> I. 7. and therefore an Evangeliſt to them, but no appearance of any Commiſſion to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern that Church: His charge to the <hi>Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> not hindring his imploiment to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> from the <hi>Philippians.</hi> On the contrary, the Commiſſions given <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> by the Epiſtles directed to them, are ſo far from being temporary, that he were no ſober man, that would give them to him, whoſe charge was intended to ceaſe to morrow. Hence we
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115786:51"/> have a competent reaſon, why the name of Biſhops ſhould be common to Biſhops and Presbyters in the New Teſtament, though the thing, which is the Power, never was. Becauſe the Chief Biſhops of that time, bore another quality, of Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, or Apoſtles of the Apoſtles, by which, while they were called, it is reaſonable to think, that other Biſhops and Presbyters, between whom, there was not that diſtance, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the greateſt of them, and Apoſtles or Evangeliſts, ſhould be called by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon name of Biſhops. An inſtance you have in the Synagogue: For, the Bodies of Jews, reſiding in the ſeverall Cities of their diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, being governed by Colleges or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtories of Presbyters, both the Heads and the Members of thoſe Colleges, are called by a common name, in the plurall number, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. So that, we are to think, that in thoſe times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, whereof the Scriptures of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115786:52"/> ſpeak, there was one ſet over the reſt, though all goe by one name, becauſe we know, that in the great Conſiſtory, whether at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or in their diſperſions, ſo it was always. By this correſpondence, having ſhewed afore, that the Power of the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, is that which the Church ſucceeds the Synagogue in, it is manifeſt, that all the ſeeming difficulty of this little objection is removed.</p>
               <p>To the argument drawn from the Angels of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> I adde onely a reply, to the anſwer that is now brought, that Angels ſtand there for Presbyteries, or Colleges of Presbyters. For now, it appears too groſſe, to take Angels for Churches, in that place, becauſe the Scripture ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, <hi>Apoc.</hi> I. 20. that the Churches are there ſignified by Candleſticks; and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears now an inconvenience, to take the Candleſtick for the Candle. But no leſſe inconvenience will be ſeen in this anſwer, if we conſider, that it muſt be proved to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſo, either by ſome reaſon of Grammar, or of Rhetorick. That an Angel is put for a Presbyter or Biſhop, is a metaphor very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, becauſe of the correſpondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. But an Angel cannot ſtand for Presbyters, by reaſon of Grammar, unleſſe either the word be a Collective, ſignifying
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115786:52"/> a multitude in the ſingular number, or elſe the Conſtruction ſhew, that the ſingular ſtands for the plurall; nor by reaſon of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, unleſſe ſome body can ſhew us, how an Angel is like a College: None of which reaſons is to be ſeen, either in the Text, or in the nature of the Subject.</p>
               <p>To the premiſes, I adde now this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, drawn from that obſervation which I have advanced, in the Book of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall form of Divine Service, <hi>p.</hi> 71. out of the Apoſtolicall Conſtitutions, <hi>Ignatius, Dionyſius Arcopagita,</hi> and the Jews Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, that, in the Primitive Church, the Presbyters were wont to ſit by themſelves, in a half Circle, at the Eaſt end of the Church, with their faces turned to the faces of the People, the Deacons ſtanding behinde them, as waiting on them, but the Biſhop, on a Throne by himſelf, in the midſt of the Presbyters ſeats. For, if this form were in uſe under the Apoſtles, then was the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Biſhops and Presbyters brought in by Ordinance of the Apoſtles. And, that it was in uſe under the Apoſtles, may appear, by the Repreſentation of the Church Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant, <hi>Apoc.</hi> IV. V. for he that knows the premiſes, and findes there XXIV Elders, equall in number, to the XII Heads of the Tribes of Iſrael, and the XII Apoſtles, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115786:53"/> with miniſtring ſpirits, ſtanding about them, as the Deacons in the Church ſtood about the Presbyters, the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtanding, with their faces turned to the Presbyters, as the People in the Church at Divine Service; how can he doubt, that the Throne of God, in the midſt of the Thrones of the XXIV Presbyters, is correſpondent to the Biſhops Chair, in the Church Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, under the Apoſtles, knowing that, ſo ſoon after the Apoſtles, juſt ſo it was ſeated? They that expound this Viſion, to reſemble the Camp of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Deſert, <hi>Numb.</hi> II. where, about the Ark, were IV Standards, anſwerable to the IV Creatures about the Throne, then, the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> invironing the Sanctuary, and the Camp of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that do make the IV Creatures as farre diſtant from the Throne, as the Standards of the IV leading Tribes were from the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and the Presbyters Seats, to compaſſe the Throne, behinde, before, and on both ſides: Whereas, in the Viſions of <hi>Eſay,</hi> VI. 1—and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> I. 1—which, all agree, that this is borrowed from, the IV Creatures ſtand cloſe to the Throne, as attending peculiarly upon Gods immediate commands.

Beſides, the Lamb is ſaid to ſtand, <gap reason="foreign">

Again, the multitude that ſtands before the Throne and the Lamb, VII. 19. are manifeſtly the ſame, that are called the ſouls under the Altar, VI. 10. though commonly, they are conceived to lie under the Altar, and from thence to cry for vengeance. For the Altar there mentioned is not the Altar of burnt Sacrifices, but the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of Incenſe before the Vail: Which Incenſe, in this Caſe, is the Prayers of the Saints, which the Elders offer, V. 8. &amp; the Angel puts Inceſe to, VIII. 3. whereupon, follows the

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115786:55"/> of the Clergy from the People by the ſame.</p>
               <p>Which Point, that I may deduce, with that care, which the conſequence of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, it will be worth the inquiry, firſt, by what title of Right, the Celebration and Conſecration of the Euchariſt, belongs only to Presbyters: which, as it ſeems to be agreed upon, on all ſides, ſo, let the Reaſon alſo once be agreed upon, why it belongs only to them, and, thereby it will appear, that it is convertible with the Power of the Keys, that is, that the Power of the Keys alſo, belongs only to Presbyters, whereas, the Offices of Preaching and baptizing, are communicable to their inferiours, and, that it belongs alſo to all Presbyters, and ſo, by conſequence, that there is no ſuch thing as Lay Elders. The Presbyterians, ſtiling their Paſtors, <hi>Miniſters of the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> in oppoſition to their Lay Elders, ſeem to ground this Right, upon the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Lord to his Apoſtles, <hi>Goe preach, and make Diſoiples all nations, Baptizing them—</hi>as if this were the Office, wherein Presbyters ſucceed the Apoſtles, though, of the Euchariſt, there is here never a word. But, if they conſider, what it is, to Preach the Goſpel to Unbeleevers, or rather, what it was, before the Goſpel was received any
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115786:55"/> where, it will eaſily appear, that, unleſſe they be mad men that go about it, it is neceſſary that they be indowed with abilities, to make it appear, even to the enemies of the Goſpel, that they are ſent by God to Preach it. Therefore, no man ſucceeds the Apoſtles, in the Office of Preaching the Goſpel to the Nations. And therefore, if they will take notice, they ſhall eaſily obſerve, that the Title of <hi>Miniſter of the Goſpel, Miniſter of the Word, of the New Teſtament, Miniſter of the Church,</hi> and others equivalent, are never gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to any but the Apoſtles, in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, unleſſe it be, to their Scholars and Subſtitutes, the Evangeliſts, becauſe they were to the Apoſtles, as the Apoſtles to Chriſt, and Chriſt to God, that is, they were Miniſters of the Apoſtles, aſſumed by them, to the work which Chriſt had truſted them in Perſon with, of Preaching the Goſpel, and planting Chriſtianity: And therefore, when need was, were able to make their Commiſſion appear, by the works they did, though in an inferiour degree, becauſe they proceeded, upon that ſtock of reputation, which the Apoſtles had won the Goſpel, by their Preaching and Miracles. Such ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, you ſhall finde attributed to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and their Followers and Subſtitutes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> III. 5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> III. VI. 4.

Thus the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> V. 42. <hi>ceaſed not to Teach and Preach Jeſus Chriſt, in Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and in the Temple: To Teach</hi> the Church, in thoſe Houſes where the Chriſtians aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ſerve God as Chriſtians, and <hi>to Preach</hi> to the Jews in the Temple, whither they reſorted for that Service, <hi>Acts</hi> II. 42, 46. So, <hi>Acts</hi> XV. 35. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued at <hi>Antiochia, Teaching,</hi> that is, the Church, and <hi>preaching the Goſpell,</hi> to wit, to Unbeleevers. And with the ſame difference, it is ſaid of our Lord in the Goſpels, <hi>Mat.</hi> IV. 23. IX. 35. XI. 1. that he <hi>Taught,</hi> to wit, as a Prophet, (who had always the Privilege of Teaching in the Synagogues, as his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples alſo by the ſame Title,) and <hi>preached the Goſpel,</hi> as ſent by God for that extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary purpoſe. But, though the Apoſtles, being ſent to preach the Goſpel, were, by conſequence, to Teach the Church, yet is it never ſaid, that Presbyters, being appointed to Teach the Church, were alſo called to Preach the Goſpel. For their Relation being, to Churches, as much perſwaded of the truth of Chriſtianity, as themſelves, they needed no ſuch qualities, as might make evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that they were ſent immediately from
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115786:57"/> God, to convince the world, of the truth of it. But onely, ſuch underſtanding in it, above the people of their reſpective Churches, as might inable them, to conduct the People thereof in it. And therefore what hindreth, their Inferiours alſo to be imploied, in Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Church, which now we call Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching? For if our Lord, and his Apoſtles, imploied their reſpective Miniſters, in Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching thoſe, whom they could not attend upon themſelves, and in all Churches, after the example of the firſt at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons or Miniſters were Ordained, to wait upon the Biſhops and Presbyters of the ſame, in the execution of their Office, is it not the ſame thing, for Biſhops and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, to imploy their Deacons, in Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to thoſe of their own Church, as it is, for the Apoſtles at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to imploy S. <hi>Steven,</hi> and S. <hi>Philip,</hi> S. <hi>Paul, Timothy,</hi> or <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> or <hi>Tychieus,</hi> or <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> in Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to Unbeleevers? for there remains as much difference, in their Charges, as in their Chiefs from whom they are imploied.

Further, the ſuppoſed S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> upon <hi>Eph.</hi> IV. 12. comparing Evangeliſts with Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, ſays, that Deacons alſo taught without a Chair: The cuſtome of the Church then, admitting them to Preach, upon occaſions, but not ſitting, as the Biſhop and Presbyters did: Becauſe they did not ſit, but ſtand, in the Church, (as the Angels in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> about the Presbyters Chairs) as attending upon their commands. And what is this, but the ſame which you finde in uſe, in the Synagogue, <hi>Acts</hi> XIII. 14. where <hi>Paul, ſtands up</hi> to Preach, whereas our Lord <hi>ſits down,</hi> like a Doctor, when he goes to Preach in the Synagogue, <hi>Luc.</hi> IV. 20? by which it appears, that it was of cuſtome, drawn from the Synagogue, for Deacons to Preach in the Church. And indeed, in the laſt place, the practice of the Synagogue, together with the reaſon of it, and the Primitive pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church, agreeable to the ſame,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115786:58"/> ſeems to make as full proof, as a reaſonable man can deſire, in a matter of this nature. For, in the Synagogue, it is ſo manifeſt, that Juriſdiction is above Doctrine, and the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Governing, above the Office of Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, that the Prophets themſelves, who were Doctors of the Law, immediately ſent by God, were ſubject to the Power and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Conſiſtory, ſetled by the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> XVII. 8,—12. So that, though by the Law, of <hi>Deut.</hi> XVIII. 18. the whole Synagogue are ſubject to Gods curſe, if they obey not the Prophet by whom God ſpeaks, yet becauſe it was poſſible, that falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets might pretend to be ſent from God, therefore, in the next words of the Law, a mark is given to diſcern who was ſent by God, and who was not, and he that preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be ſent by God and was not, being tried by this mark, became liable to capitall puniſhment, by the Law of <hi>Deut.</hi> XVII. 8,—12. for teaching contrary to that which the Conſiſtory taught. So that, by this Law, the Conſiſtory hath Power of life and death, even over Prophets, whom they judged to teach things deſtructive to the Law. And by this Power, not uſurped, but abuſed, our Lord alſo ſuffered, under <hi>Pilate,</hi> according to that which he had ſaid in reſpect of this Power, <hi>It is unpoſsible that a Prophet periſh out</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:115786:58"/> 
                  <hi>of Jeruſalem, Luc.</hi> XIII. 33. that is, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Conſiſtory. The Succeſſors of the Prophets, after the Spirit of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ceaſed, that is, their Scribes, and Wiſe men, and Doctors, received the Privilege of Teaching the Law, from their Maſters. For, whoſoever had learned in the School of a Doctor, till forty years of age, was thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth counted a Doctor, as the Talmud Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors determine, and thereby privileged to decide matters of Conſcience in the Law, provided that he did it not while his Maſter lived, and where he was: <hi>R. Solomon</hi> upon the Title <hi>Sanedrin</hi> X. 2. <hi>Maimoni</hi> in the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Learning the Law, <hi>cap.</hi> V. But if I miſtake not, in our Lords time, they were counted ſo at thirty years of age. For <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> II. 39. ſays, that our Lord began to Preach, at the ſame age, at which men were counted Doctors, manifeſtly referring to this Rule of the Synagogue. And this is the Reaſon which the Church afterwards fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, in all thoſe Canons, by which it is forbidden that any man be made Presbyter, being leſſe then thirty years of age: becauſe at thoſe years our Lord and S. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> began to Preach, though by an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Commiſſion, yet according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Synagogue in their time, ſaith <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> But, by Impoſition of Hands, they
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115786:59"/> were further qualified, to ſit and Judge in their Conſiſtories. Whereby we ſee, how Juriſdiction includes Doctrine, but is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in it: So that, the Metaphoricall Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Church by the power of the Keys, belonging, as all ſides agree, to Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, it is agreeable to the perpetuall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of Gods people, that the Office of Teaching, be communicable to their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. But with ſuch dependence, upon the Biſhop and Presbyters, as may be correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Rule of the Synagogue; In which, he that taught any thing, as of Gods Law, contrary to the Conſiſtory, and perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in it, was liable to capitall puniſhment, by the Law ſo often quoted, of <hi>Deut.</hi> XVII. 8<hi>—Sanedrin</hi> X. 2. <hi>Maimoni</hi> in the Title of Rebels, <hi>cap.</hi> III. And therefore, he that Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches contrary to the Church, it behoveth, that he be liable to Excommunication from it. And upon theſe terms, I ſuppoſe, thoſe of the Congregations will give me no great thanks, for ſaying, that it is not againſt Gods Law, that thoſe, who are not in Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, do Preach. For, that which I have alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for this, in the Apoſtolicall form of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, <hi>p.</hi> 420. out of that notable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle in <hi>Euſebius, Eccleſ. Hiſt.</hi> VI. 20. in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of <hi>Origen,</hi> who, before he was Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was imploied in Preaching by the Biſhop
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115786:59"/> of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> conſiſts in divers inſtances, of other perſons of <hi>Origens</hi> rank, which Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched indeed, but all, by Commiſſion from their reſpective Biſhops, who were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their Places, the Doctors in Chief, of their reſpective Churches. And if this be againſt Divine Right, (as we agree it is, for any under the rank of a Presbyter, to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Euchariſt,) how ſhall any Church allow men to Preach, for triall of their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, before they attain that rank, in which they are ordinarily to doe it?</p>
               <p>That which hath been ſaid of Preaching, is to be ſaid much more, in my opinion, of Baptiſm. If the charge of Baptizing, given the Apoſtles, had been meant, of the Office of Miniſtring, not of the power of granting it, what reaſon could there be, that S. <hi>Peter,</hi> having converted <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſhould not baptize them in perſon, but command them to be baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> IX. 48? And if the Apoſtles, imploy their Deacon S. <hi>Philip,</hi> to Preach and to Baptize, is it not by conſequence, that the Governours of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, imploy their Deacons about the ſame? In the Synagogue, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid, that the office of Circumciſing, ever required any higher quality, then that of a perſon circumciſed: And therefore in the Church, if there can be any queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115786:60"/> a perſon is to be admitted to Baptiſm or not, it is the Chief Power of the Church, that muſt determine it. Or, if the occaſion require Solemnity, which may argue, him that Officiates it, to be Chief in the Church, no Deacon nor Presbyter muſt preſume to doe it before the Biſhop. But, becauſe Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is the gate, as well of the inviſible Church, as of the viſible; and becauſe the occaſions are many and divers, which indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the preventing of ſo neceſſary an Office, by death, in this regard, the practice of the Primitive Church, alleged by <hi>Tertullian, de Bapt. cap.</hi> XVIII, muſt not be condemned, whereby, Baptiſm, given by him that is only baptized, is not onely valid, but well done. Though my intent hereby is not to ſay, that it may not be reſtrained to Presbyters and Deacons, when the Church is ſo provided of them, that there is no appearance, that Baptiſme can be prevented, for want of one.</p>
               <p>But though I doe, for theſe cauſes, refuſe the reaſon that Presbyterians can give, why onely Presbyters may celebrate the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt. I am not therefore much more in love with that, which the School Doctors give, when they conceive, that the Apoſtles were made Prieſts, by our Lord, at his laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, when he ſaid, <hi>Do this.</hi> For, we do not find
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:115786:60"/> this expoſition of theſe words authorized by the firſt ages of the Church, or any Writers of that time. And, where the School Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ſpeak not out of the mouth of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, I make no difficulty to take them for none of my Authors And truly, in this caſe, the Text of the Scripture ſeems to be plain enough, for, the Command of our Lord, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me,</hi> muſt needs ſpeak to the ſame perſons, as the reſt that goes afore, <hi>Take, eate, drink, divide this among you,</hi> which, belonging to the whole Church, it is manifeſt, the Precept, <hi>Do this,</hi> belonging alſo to the whole Church, cannot make any difference of qualities in it. In this difficulty then, it will be hard to find any anchor ſo ſure, as that of <hi>Tertullian, De Cor. cap.</hi> III. where, making a Catalogue of Orders and Rules obſerved in the Church, which are not found delivered, in terms of Precept, in the Scriptures, he proſecuteth it thus: <hi>Euchariſtiae Sacramentum, in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re victus, &amp; omnibus, à Domino mandatum, etiam antelucanis coetibus, nec niſi de manu Praeſidentium ſumimus. The Sacrament of the Euchariſt was commended to the Church at meat,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian.</hi> Is not this the expreſſe word of our Lord? for, when he ſaith, <hi>Doe this,</hi> is it not manifeſt, that he commandeth to celebrate the Euchariſt at the end of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115786:61"/> as himſelf preſently had done? Sure enough the Primitive Church underſtood it ſo, for <hi>the Miniſtery of Tables</hi> in the Acts of the Apoſtles, for which the Apoſtles provide themſelves Deacons, and the Feaſts of Love, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> regulates at <hi>Corinth,</hi> are enough to ſhew us, that the Euchariſt came at the end of them. And ſo <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſhews that it was in his time, when he ſayes, that they received the Euchariſt <hi>at their Aſſemblies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore day alſo;</hi> that is to ſay, as well as at their Feaſts of Love, at which our Lord ordained it. But, though there be no Precept extant in the Scripture, that the Euchariſt be uſed at thoſe Aſſemblies of the Church, which are held meerly for the Service of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe Feaſts of Love, yet if my reaſons, propounded in the Apoſtolicall Form of Divine Service, <hi>p.</hi> 291. have not failed, which hitherto, ſo far as I know, are not contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, it doth appear by the Scripture, that it was ſo under the Apoſtles. And therefore, that onely Presbyters are to celebrate the Euchariſt, the Church will be confidently aſſured, becauſe it appears, by theſe words of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that this was the Primitive practice of the Church. Eſpecially, if by any circumſtance of Scripture, it may appear to have been derived from the Apoſtles. Which, perhaps, comparing the premiſes
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115786:61"/> with the nature of the Euchariſt, will not fail us. To ſhew, that thoſe who did eat of the Sacrifices of the Gentiles, were acceſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their Idolatries, the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> X. 16—inſtanceth in the Jews, who, by eating of their Sacrifices, <hi>did communicate with the Altar,</hi> that is, with God, to whom that which was conſumed upon the Altar belonged. And becauſe Chriſtianity ſuppoſeth, that the Gentiles Sacrifices were offered to Devils, therefore, (the Gentiles communicating with Devils, by eating the remains of their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as the Jews with God) that it was not lawfull, to eat of their Sacrifices, for them that communicated with God, in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, as the Jews did with the ſame true God, and the Gentiles with the Devils, by their Sacrifices. Thus, the Apoſtles argument ſuppoſeth, that, in the Euchariſt, Chriſtians do participate of the Sacrifice of the Croſſe, as Jews and Gentiles do, of their Sacrifices, and ſo, that the purpoſe thereof is, that, by it, we may participate of the Sacrifice offered to God upon the Croſſe. Which, being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by our Lord within the Vail, into the moſt Holy Place of the Heavens, to be preſented to God, as it is declared at large, <hi>Hebr.</hi> IX. 11—is, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, no leſſe participated by Chriſtians, then the Jews do participate of their peace-Offerings.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115786:62"/> Which the Apoſtle teaches again, when he tels the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> XIII. 10. that <hi>we have an Altar,</hi> that is, a Sacrifice, <hi>of which they that ſerve the Tabernacle have no right to eat;</hi> that is, no Jews. For, ſeeing the Prieſts only eat the remains of burnt Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, whereas the remains of peace Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings are eaten alſo by the Sacrificers, that which the Prieſts touch not, it is manifeſt that no Jew can have right to touch. And, that the Sacrifice of the Croſſe is ſuch, he proceedeth to prove, becauſe, as he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the premiſes, it is of that kinde, that was carried within the Vail; and again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, in correſpondence, to the burning of the reſt of thoſe Sacrifices, without the Camp, which the Law enjoyned <hi>Levit.</hi> IV. 12, 20. VI. 30. XVI. 21. our Lord ſuffered without <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Now, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the diſcourſe propounded by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, to ſhew, how Chriſtians participate of that Sacrifice, whereof he hath proved that Jews do not; he addeth, <hi>Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore goe forth to him out of the Camp, bearing his reproach, for we have here no abiding City, but ſeek one to come: Let us therefore by him offer the Sacrifice of Praiſe continually to God, even the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his Name.</hi> Which, if we will have to be perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the premiſes, muſt all be meant of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115786:62"/> the Euchariſt, in which, the Sacrifice of the Croſſe is communicated to Chriſtians. Not as if thereby the Apoſtle did eſtabliſh that ſtrange prodigious conceit, of repeating the Sacrifice of the Croſſe, and ſacrificing Chriſt anew, in every Maſſe. In as much as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle clearly declareth, that the ſame one individuall Sacrifice, which Chriſt carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Holy of Holies, through the Vail, to preſent to God, is that which all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans participate of, in the Euchariſt, always. And therefore the Euchariſt is a Sacrifice, no otherwiſe, then as all Euchariſts, that have been, or ſhall be, to the worlds end, can be underſtood, to be the ſame one indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall Sacrifice of Chriſt upon the Croſſe: Which how it is to be underſtood, this is not the place to diſpute. Here is further to be remembred, that which I have proved, in the Apoſtolicall Form of Divine Service, <hi>p.</hi> 343, 373. that it is Ordained by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, which hath been practiſed by the Church after them, in all ages, that, at the celebration of the Euchariſt, ſupplications and prayers be made, for all eſtates and ranks in the Church, for all things, concerning the common neceſſities of it. The reaſon and intent whereof, is ſtill more manifeſt by the premiſes. For, if the prayers of the Church be accepted of God, in conſideration of the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115786:63"/> Sacrifice of the Croſſe, appearing always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne of God, within the Vail, to intercede for us: Is it not all reaſon, that the Church, when it celebrateth the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance thereof upon earth, ſhould offer and preſent it to God, as the only powerfull means, to commend the Prayers of the Church unto God, and to obtain our neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities at his hands? If theſe things then be ſo, let us call to minde the Propheticall Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, repreſented to S. <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> of the Throne of God, and of the Church Triumphant, divided, into XXIV Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſitting about the Throne of God, and the people of the Church, ſtanding and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the Throne and the Elders, in the very ſame manner, as they did, at the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the Church Militant, at Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Whereby, it is manifeſt, that God granteth the Decrees, which are foretold in that Prophecy, at the Prayers of the Church Triumphant, preſented to his Throne, in the ſame manner, as the Prayers of the Church Militant here upon earth. And upon theſe premiſes, I ſuppoſe, it will be no hard thing to make the conſequence, from that which is ſaid, <hi>Apoc.</hi> IV. 8. <hi>The XXIV Elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one Harps, and golden Vials, full of incenſe, which are the Prayers of the Saints.</hi> The conſequence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:115786:63"/> no more but this, that, ſeeing all things elſe, in this Viſion, are correſpondent to the order of the Militant Church, therefore it is plain, that the Presbyters in the Church Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant, are ſaid to hold in their hands the Prayers of the Saints, becauſe, in the Church Militant, the Presbyters were to preſent the Prayers of the Church to God, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, to celebrate the Euchariſt, which the Prayers of the Church were always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to God with. Which is further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, in that the Church, or the place, in Heaven, where this Aſſembly of the Church Triumphant is repreſented to S. <hi>John,</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led divers times, in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi>

                  </gap>, where it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that the Church is called a Sanctuary, or Place of Sacrificing, ſeeing no man can be ſaid to be without the Altar, becauſe not within it. Neither is it any marvell, that in the repreſentation of the Triumphant Church, in this Propheticall Viſion, by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the Aſſembly of the Church upon earth, regard is had chiefly, to the celebration of the Euchariſt. Becauſe, as it is that part of the Service of God, which is altogether peculiar to the Church, as the Sacrifice of the Croſſe is peculiar to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, whereas other Offices of Divine Service, Prayer, the Praiſes of God, and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the People, are common, not only to Judaiſm, but, in ſome ſort, to other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, never Ordained by God: So is it the Chief and principall part of it: though, in this Age, where ſo much hath been ſaid of Reforming the Church, we hear not a word,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115786:64"/> of reſtoring the frequent celebration and communion of it. It is to be wiſhed indeed, that continuall Preaching be maintained in all Churches, as it is to be wiſhed, that all Gods people were Prophets: And it is to be commended, that the abuſe of private Maſſes is taken away. But if order be not taken, that thoſe which are ſet up to Preach, may Preach no more, then they have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of the Scriptures, it will be eaſie, to drive a worſe Trade of Preaching, then ever Prieſts did of private Maſſes: The one ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding only to feed themſelves, the other, to turn the good order of the world, which is the Harbour of the Church, into publique confuſion, to feed themſelves; the profaning of Gods Ordinance, being common to both. And if the taking away of private Maſſes, muſt be, by turning the Euchariſt out of doors, ſaving twice or thrice a year, for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions ſake, it is but <hi>Lycurgus</hi> his Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſtock up the Vines, for fear men be drunk with the wine. The Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is clear in this buſineſſe. The Order whereof, as it earneſtly ſighs, and grones, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the reſtoring of publique Penance, the onely mean, eſtabliſhed by the Apoſtles, to maintain the Church, in eſtate to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate continually, ſo, it recommendeth the continuall celebration of the Euchariſt, at all
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115786:65"/> the more ſolemne Aſſemblies, of Lords days and Feſtivals. As for the Sermon, it is to be when it can be had, and were it now abated, when ſuch Sermons cannot bee had, as were fitting, it is eaſie to undertake, that there would be room enough left, for the celebration of the Euchariſt. In the mean time, the Reformers of this Age, had they conſidered ſo well as it behoved them, what they undertook, ſhould eaſily have found, that the continuall celebration of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, at all the more ſolemne Aſſemblies of the Church, and the Diſcipline of Penance, to maintain the people, in a diſpoſition fit to communicate in it, is ſuch a point of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the Church, that without reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, all the reſt, is but meer noiſe, and pretence, if not miſchief.</p>
               <p>Now, the reaſon, why the celebration of the Euchariſt is reſerved to Presbyters alone, in conſequence to the premiſes, is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and will be effectuall to ſhew, that it is common to all Presbyters, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that there is no ſuch thing as Lay El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. For, ſeeing all agree, that Presbyters have their ſhare in the Power of the Keys, though the Chief Intereſs in it be the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, according to the Doctrine of the Church, and, ſeeing the work of this Power, is to admit, to the Prayers of the Church, as
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115786:65"/> S. <hi>John</hi> ſheweth, when he deſcribeth Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, by not praying for the ſins of the excommunicate; and ſeeing it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by S. <hi>James,</hi> that the Prayers of the Church, for the ſins of them whom the Church prayeth for, are the Prayers of the Presbyters, what can we conceive more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and conſequent to the premiſes, then, that the Power of the Keys, is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with the Office of celebrating the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, belonging to the Biſhop and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters by virtue of it? For, what can be more agreeable, then, that the Prayers of the Church, which the Euchariſt is celebrated with, be offered by thoſe, that are to diſcern, who is to be admitted, who excluded, from the ſame? This is the meaning of <hi>Joſephus</hi> the Jew in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> againſt the Ebionites, where, being baptized by the Biſhop of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berias,</hi> at his parting he gives him money, ſaying, <hi>Offer for me, for it is written, Whoſe ſins ye remit they are remitted, and whoſe ſins ye retain they are retained.</hi> Expreſſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, the ſenſe of Primitive Chriſtians, who, when they were admitted to the Prayers of the Church, which the Euchariſt is offered to God with, made account thereby, that the Power of the Keys was paſsed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually did paſſe upon them, to the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins. Whereupon we ſee, that it is an
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115786:66"/> ordinary cenſure of the ancient Canons, that he which did ſo or ſo, <hi>his oblations be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi> that is, that he be out of the number of thoſe, for whom the Prayers of the Church are made, which the Euchariſt is offered with. Therefore, <hi>Ignatius</hi> thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuteth the words laſt quoted: <hi>He that is without the Sanctuary,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>comes ſhort of the Bread of God. For if the Prayer of one or two be ſo forcible with God, what ſhall we think of the Prayer of the Biſhop, and the whole Church?</hi> For, the efficacy of the Prayers of the Church, dependeth upon the Unity of the Church: And the Power of the Keys, is that, which containeth that Unity: It is therefore agreeable, that thoſe Prayers, which are of this efficacy, be the Prayers of them, whom this Unity, and the Power which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it, is truſted with. And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though all Chriſtians be Prieſts, as the Scripture ſays, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> II. 5. <hi>Apoc.</hi> I. 6. by a far better title, then <hi>Moſes</hi> promiſes the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, <hi>Ex.</hi> XIX. 6. The Sacrifice of Prayer being the act of the whole Church: Yet notwithſtanding, it is by good right, that Biſhops and Presbyters are called <hi>Sacerdotes</hi> or <hi>Sacrificers,</hi> in regard of the ſame Sacrifice, of Prayer and Thankſgiving, for which all Chriſtians are called Sacrificers: That is to ſay, by way of excellence, becauſe that which
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115786:66"/> is the act of all, is by ordinance of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, (paſſed upon the whole Church) reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be executed, and miniſtred by them, whom that Power, which preſerveth that U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which inforceth the Prayers of the Church, is truſted with.</p>
               <p>He that refuſeth this reaſon, as built upon conſequences that convince not, muſt by conſequence acknowledge, that the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Euchariſt, is peculiar to Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, meerly by univerſall and perpetuall practice of the Church, derived from the Order ſetled by the Apoſtles. Which, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe of the Presbyteries will admit, I leave to themſelves to adviſe. For, as for their pretenſe, that the Miniſtery of both Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, is convertible with the Office of Preaching, upon which they ſtyle their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, or Preaching Elders, <hi>Miniſters of the Word and Sacraments,</hi> it appears to be as void of any ground from the Scriptures, as it is wide from the originall and Univerſall practice of the Church. The <hi>Miniſtery of the Word,</hi> being the Office of Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, according to the Scriptures: The Miniſtery of Baptiſm, and Preaching, communicable to Deacons, and poſſibly to Lay men, onely the celebration of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, proper to the Power of the Keys, in Biſhops and Presbyters. But, putting all
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115786:67"/> the reaſons that here are advanced to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe, yet, out of the premiſes, we have two effectuall arguments, to convince the nullity of Lay Elders. The firſt, from the manner of ſitting in the Church: In as much as it hath been ſhewed, that the Order and cuſtome of it, is to be derived from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles themſelves, as being in uſe in their time. For, if the manner of their ſitting in the Church, were ſo diſtinguiſhed, that all the Presbyters ſate in one Rank, in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt Room, with the Biſhop in the midſt, that is, in the Head of them, his Seat advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced above theirs, as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> witneſſeth of the Biſhops of <hi>Alexandria</hi> from S. <hi>Mark,</hi> from which manner of ſitting, they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Greek Fathers <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as in the Scriptures <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and in <hi>Tertullian praeſidentes,</hi> how can common ſenſe deſire better evidence, that there are but two qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, generally diſtinguiſhable in the Church, the one of Presbyters, ſometimes called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> V. 17. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> V. 14. ſometimes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Heb.</hi> XIII. 14, 17. ſomtimes <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> II. 2. <hi>Tit.</hi> I. 5, 7. comprehending Biſhop and Presbyters for the reaſons alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, (for to theſe the Deacons, as their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, are to be referred) the other of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? The ſame that in <hi>Tertullian</hi> are called <hi>Ordo &amp; Plebs,</hi> in all ages of the Church,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115786:67"/> ſince the Apoſtles, the Clergy and People. Secondly, ſeeing it is manifeſt, that the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Keys is above the Office of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Chriſtian Church, (indeed equall to that of celebrating the Euchariſt) it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that it is againſt the Order declared by the Scripture, that the Power of the Keys ſhould be in any man, that is not allowed to Preach and celebrate the Euchariſt; and therefore, that, by having the Power of the Keys, a man is by Right qualified to doe it. And truly, I doe much marvell, how this conſequence can be refuſed, as to the Office of Preaching, when as S. <hi>Paul</hi> requires, both of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> that the Presbyters which they ordain, be, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>fit to teach.</hi> For, no common ſenſe can allow, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, having the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, not from Preaching, but from Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, is not to comprehend Governing Elders as well as Preachers. Therefore the Scriptures make thoſe Preachers, whom the Presbyteries make Governing Elders. Here follows a third argument, drawn from that onely Text of the Apoſtle, upon which their Lay Elders are grounded, with any appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> V. 17. <hi>Let the Elders that Rule well be counted worthy of double honour, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe that labour in the Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;</hi> For, by the Apoſtles Diſcourſe, it is
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:115786:68"/> manifeſt, and, ſo far as I perceive, agreed on all hands, that the word <hi>Honour,</hi> here ſpoken of, is, maintenance. S. <hi>Pauls</hi> inſtruction ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, the Order ſetled by the Apoſtles to be this, that there ſhould be, in all Churches, ſetled in Cities, as aforeſaid, a common ſtock, at the diſpoſing of Biſhop and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, riſing from the Oblations of the faithfull, out of which, firſt, thoſe that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Government of the Church, and the Offices of Divine Service, then, thoſe that could not attend the Service of God, without maintenance from the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, might finde ſubſiſtence. For hereupon it is, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth <hi>Timothy,</hi> to <hi>honour widows indeed,</hi> that were deſtitute of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from their friends, that they might abide in prayers and ſupplications, as <hi>Anna</hi> the Propheteſſe, <hi>Luc.</hi> II. 36. and <hi>Iudith,</hi> VIII. 5. and the good women that waited at the Tabernacle, <hi>Ex.</hi> XXXVIII. 8. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> II. 24. And when he ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he ſhews, that there was then a Liſt of them, called here <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by Church Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, afterwards, <hi>Canon,</hi> which, whoſoever was entred into, received appointment from the Church, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> V. 5, 9, 16. Let it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſaid no more, that the diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Clergy and people, is not found in the Scriptures. For how can the Office be more
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115786:68"/> expreſly diſtinguiſhed, then by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is allowed, for the execution of it? And therefore, when S. <hi>Peter</hi> charges the Presbyters, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> V. 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he means not the people, but he means the ſame which <hi>Clemens</hi> in <hi>Euſebius,</hi> when he ſays, that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> was wont to go abroad from <hi>Epheſus</hi> to forein Churches, on purpoſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, to Ordain ſome Clergy man, that ſhould be ſignified by the Spirit: For in both places, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is taken for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſo S. <hi>Peters</hi> precept, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, conſiſts of two members, not to domineer over the Clergy that were under them, that is, the Deacons, Widows, and Deaconeſſes, and, to be a Pattern to the Flock. In this Diſcourſe of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> we have a further reaſon of difference, between the Clergy and people, from that Rule of life and converſation, to which the Clergy was ſubject, by the Primitive Diſcipline of the Church. For, if the Church allowed Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows an appointment, in conſideration of their daily attendance, upon the Service of God, much more are we bound to conceive, that Presbyters, whom the Apoſtle allows a double appointment, are tied to double at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on the ſame Service. A thing
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115786:69"/> which cannot be expected of thoſe who are tied to the World: and therefore, <hi>Tertullian De Praeſcript. cap.</hi> XLI. condemneth the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, becauſe their faſhion was, to make ſecular men Presbyters. Seeing then, that the Apoſtle alloweth the ſame double ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, to the whole Order of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, let them that ſet up Lay Elders, ask their own Conſciences, whether they can be content to allow them the ſame maintenance from the Church, as themſelves receive, otherwiſe, let them not imagine, that they can ſet them up by this Scripture. For, that ſome Presbyters ſhould labour in Preaching, though all are required <hi>to be apt to Preach,</hi> is no inconvenience, in that State, when Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations were not diſtinguiſhed, but the whole Office, reſted in the whole Order of the Clergy, in relation, to the whole Body, of the People of a Church. You ſee by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XIV. that one Aſſembly whereof he ſpeaks there, furniſhed with a great number of Prophets, whether Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, or over and above them. In the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Church, we find divers times, a whole Bench of Presbyters preſiding at one Aſſembly. Is any man ſo unſatiable of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, as to think the Church unprovided of it, unleſſe all thoſe Preached at all times? Is it not enough, that <hi>Timothy</hi> is required, to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115786:69"/> 
                  <hi>count them eſpecially worthy double honour</hi> that labour in it? for by this means, thoſe that laboured not in it, when and how <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> finds it requiſite, muſt know, that their maintenance muſt come harder from his hands. For the laſt argument, I muſt not forget the perpetuall practice of the Church, though I name, for the preſent, but the words of <hi>Clemens,</hi> Diſciple to the Apoſtles, who, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to compoſe a difference among the Presbyters of that Church, partly about the celebration of the Euchariſt, adviſes them to agree and take their turns in it. If all the Presbyters might take their turns in it, then all might celebrate the Euchariſt: if in that Church, then in all Churches. I know many Church Writers are quoted to prove Lay Elders: For that alſo is grown a point of Learning, to load the Margin with Texts of Scripture, and allegations of Authors, in hope, no man will take the pains to compare them, becauſe, if he do, he ſhall eaſily finde them nothing to the purpoſe. For inſtance. My ſelf have the honour to be alleged, for one that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove Lay Elders, even in that place, of that very Diſcourſe, where I anſwer the beſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that ever I heard made for them, onely, becauſe I ſaid then, as now, that we are not bound to think, that all Presbyters
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115786:70"/> Preached during the Apoſtles times. What reaſon then can any Reader have to preſume, that any of their dead witneſſes make more for their purpoſe, then I who am alive, and ſtand to ſee my ſelf alleged, point blank againſt the poſition which I intended to prove, becauſe, forſooth, in their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the premiſes which I uſe, ſtand not with the concluſion which I intended to prove? But to ſpeak plain Engliſh for the future, if any man can ſhew, by any writing of any Chriſtian, from the Apoſtles, to this innovation, any man indowed with the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Keys, that was not alſo qualified to Preach and to celebrate the Euchariſt, I am content to be of the Presbyteries the next morning, though I am ſo well ſatisfied, that it will never be ſhewed, that I ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, it will always be to morrow.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe the Power of the Keys, that is, the whole Power of the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that Power is the root and ſource, is common to Biſhop and Presbyters, it is here demanded, what Act we can ſhew, peculiar to the Biſhop, by precept of Gods Word, for which, that Order, may be ſaid, to be ſuperiour to that of Presbyters. A demand, ſutable to the definition of the Schoole, wherein, an <hi>Order</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>a Power to doe ſome ſpeciall Act:</hi> But extremely wide of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115786:70"/> the Terms that have been held heretofore. Have we been told all this while, that the Presbyteries are the Throne and Scepter of Chriſt, the force and Power of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, hath ſo much Chriſtian blood been drawn for the Cauſe, and now, in ſtead of ſhewing, that they are either commanded, or conſiſtent with the Word of God, is it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that the Government in poſſeſſion, in the Church, from the Apoſtles, ſhew reaſon why it cannot be aboliſhed, though inſtituted by the Apoſtles? Surely, though this is poſſible to be ſhewed, yet, though it could not be ſhewed, it might be beyond any Power on earth, to aboliſh the Order of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. For my part, I conceive, I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heretofore, that the Power of every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Church, was depoſited by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, with the reſpective Biſhop and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and that therefore, in the ages next to the Apoſtles, the advice and conſent of the Presbyters did concurre with the Biſhop, in ordering of Eccleſiaſticall matters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Congregations were not yet diſtinct, but a Biſhop and Presbyters, over the common Body of each Church. Over and above what hath been ſaid, the condemning of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and of <hi>Noetus</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> are expreſly ſaid by <hi>Epiphanius, Haer.</hi> XLII. <hi>num.</hi> I <hi>&amp;</hi> II. <hi>Haer.</hi> LVII. <hi>nu.</hi> I. to have been done &amp;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115786:71"/> paſſed, by the Act of the Presbyters of thoſe Churches; The difference between <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> Biſhop, and <hi>Arius</hi> Presbyter of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> is ſaid to have riſen, at a meeting and debate of that Biſhop and his Presbyters, in the letter of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to thoſe two, repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Euſebius, De Vitâ Conſtant.</hi> II. <hi>cap. pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nult.</hi> And <hi>Epiphanius, Haer.</hi> LXIX. <hi>num.</hi> III.

And all this, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the practice recorded in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. For, when S. <hi>Paul</hi> inſtructeth <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> ſaying, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> V. 19, 20. <hi>Againſt a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter receive not an accuſation, but under two or three witneſſes.

And, is it not manifeſt, that S. <hi>James,</hi> firſt gives S. <hi>Paul</hi> audience, in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory of the Presbyters, to adviſe what courſe to take, before the Congregation be acquainted with the buſineſſe, <hi>Acts</hi> XXI. 18—? The ſame being the practice of S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, when <hi>Cornelius</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

                  </gap> or Conſiſtories appointed there to be held every week, for compoſing all differences, againſt the Lords Day. And therefore, as for my part, the learned <hi>Blon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell</hi> might have ſpared all his exact diligence, to ſhew, that Presbyters did concurre with the Biſhop, in acts of this nature. The cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning would be in proving the conſequence, that therefore, Biſhop and Presbyters are all one, which all common ſenſe diſavows. For, be it granted, which he inſiſteth upon ſo much, that, (as the Commentary upon S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles under S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his Name relateth, <hi>Eph.</hi> IV. 11.) at the firſt, the eldeſt of the Presbyters, was wont to be taken into the place of the Biſhop: (For it is probable, that this courſe was kept in ſome places, though his conjectures will not ſerve to prove, that it was a generall Rule) what will this inable him to inferre, as for the power of the Biſhop, being once received into the firſt place? who knows very well the gallant ſpeech of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> recorded by <hi>Ammia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, lib.</hi> XXVI. to the very Army that had choſen him Emperour, and at the inſtant of his inauguration, began to mutiny about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting their choice, that it was in their
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115786:72"/> power to chooſe an Emperour, before they had done it: Intimating, that being choſen, it was not in their power to withdraw their obedience. For by the ſame reaſon, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be the means that promoted the Biſhop, the meaſure of the power to which he was promoted, muſt be taken from the Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Church by the Apoſtles, expreſſed by the practice of it: As there is no doubt, but the Romane Emperors were advanced to an abſolute Power, though by the choice of their Souldiers. It is not my purpoſe to ſay, that the Power of the Biſhop, in the Church, is ſuch: But it is my purpoſe, to appeal to common ſenſe, and daily experience, and to demand, whether in thoſe Societies, or Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which conſiſt of a ſtanding Councell, and a Head thereof, indowed with the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of a Negative, the Power of the Head, and of the ſeverall members, be one and the ſame? If not, then is there the ſame diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Biſhop and the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by the Scriptures, interpreted by the Originall practice of the Church. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions addreſſed to <hi>Timothy</hi> &amp; <hi>Titus,</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, obliged not them alone, but all that were concerned to yeeld obedience, to what, thereby, they are commanded to doe. If any thing, concerning the ſubject of thoſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, could have paſſed without <hi>Timothy</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:115786:72"/> and <hi>Titus,</hi> they were all a meer nullity. For inſtance, if, by the Presbyters Votes, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation might have been made, without <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> they might commit ſin, and the blame thereof lie on <hi>Timothies</hi> ſcore; to which S. <hi>Paul, if he lay hands ſuddenly on any man,</hi> makes him liable. So, the Angels of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Churches, as they are commended for the good, ſo are they charged with the ſins of their Churches. Which, how can it be reaſonable, but for the eminent power in them, without which no publick thing could paſſe? I do here willingly mention <hi>Ignatius,</hi> becauſe of the injuſtice of that exception, that is made againſt him. Surely, had we none but the old Copy, which, for my part, is freely confeſſed to be interpolated, and mixed with paſſages of a later hand; I would confidently appeal to the common ſenſe of any man, not faſcinated with prejudice, how that can be imagined to be always foiſted in, which is the perpetuall ſubject of all his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: Dwelling onely upon the avoiding of Hereſy and Schiſm, and the avoiding of Schiſm, every where inculcated to conſiſt in this, that without the Biſhop nothing be done, and all with advice of the Presbyters. But, it ſeems to me a ſpeciall act of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the true Copy of theſe Epiſtles, free from all ſuch mixture, is publiſhed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115786:73"/> this diſpute among us. Which, the L. Primate of <hi>Ireland</hi> having firſt ſmelt out, by the Latine Tranſlation which he publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, <hi>Iſaak Voſsius,</hi> according as he preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, hath now found, and publiſhed, out of the Library at <hi>Florence,</hi> farre enough from ſuſpition of partiality in this cauſe. Nor is the learned <hi>Blondell</hi> to be regarded, preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to ſtigmatize ſo clear a Record for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. It ſeemes, that his Book was written before he ſaw this Copy; and had he not condemned it, in his Preface, he muſt have ſuppreſſed and condemned his own work. But when it appears, that this Record is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as true and native, of all that are able to judge of letters, it muſt appear, by conſequence, that he hath given ſentence againſt his own Book. In the mean time, it is to be lamented, that, by the force of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, ſo learned a man, had rather, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of ſo many pregnant authorities, of a companion of the Apoſtles, againſt the Socinians, ſhould be loſt to the Church, then part with his own, whether opinion, or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe, condemned by the ſame evidence. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, thoſe weak exceptions, from the ſtyle of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> have more in them of will then of reaſon, to all that have reliſhed that ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of language, which, (called by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) is to be ſeen in the writings
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115786:73"/> of Apoſtolicall perſons, <hi>Irenaeus, Juſtine, Clemens Romanus,</hi> and after them <hi>Epiphani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and the Apoſtolicall Conſtitutions: And he was very forward to finde exceptions, that could imagine, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> calleth the Order of Biſhops <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe he ſo qualifieth the Ordination of <hi>Damas,</hi> Biſhop of the <hi>Magneſians,</hi> being a young man when he was ordained Biſhop. As for the mention of the <hi>Valentinians</hi> Hereſie in them, he hath been fully told, again and again, that the ſeeds of it are extant before <hi>Ignatius,</hi> in the writings of the Apoſtles. But, as to my preſent purpoſe, he that conſiders, of what conſequence, the Unity of the Church is, to the advancement of Chriſtianity, and of what conſequence, not only <hi>Ignatius,</hi> but S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> and all men of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, profeſſe the Power of Biſhops to be, to the preſervation of Unity in the Church, will not begge the queſtion with <hi>Blondell,</hi> by condemning <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epiſtles, becauſe the one half of the ſubject of them, is this one Rule, nothing to be done without the Biſhop, all things to be done by advice of the Presbyters. That to the <hi>Philadelphians</hi> is remarkable above the reſt, where he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that, having no intelligence, from any man, of the diviſions that were among them, the Holy Ghoſt revealing it to him, ſaid
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115786:74"/> within him, for the means of compoſing them, <hi>Without the Biſhop let nothing be done.</hi> If it be ſaid, that this Rule is ineffectuall, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, rather then expediting, the courſe of buſineſſe: The anſwer is, that it is enough, that thus much is determined by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, the reſt remaining to be further limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by humane right, as the ſtate of the Church ſhall require.</p>
               <p>According to this Rule, it is juſtly ſaid, that Baptiſm is not given, but by a Biſhop, as it is given only by thoſe, whom the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of any Church, which was never put in force, without the Biſhop, inableth to give it. A thing manifeſtly ſeen by Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. What reaſon can we imagine, that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the Deacon, being inabled to doe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, for the converſion of the Samaritanes, was not inabled to give the Holy Ghoſt, but the Apoſtles muſt come down to do it? Was it not to ſhew, that all graces of that kinde, were ſubject to the graces of the Apoſtles, in the Viſible Church, whereof they were then Chief Governours? So that, as then, thoſe that received the Holy Ghoſt, were thereby demonſtrated to be members of the Viſible Church, in which God evidenced his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, by that grace: So was it always found requiſite, that Chriſtians be acknowledged members of the Viſible Church, by the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115786:74"/> and Bleſſing of their Succeſſors. Which Order, as it ſerves to demonſtrate this Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, to all that are void of prejudice, ſo, had it been improved, to this Apoſtolicall intent, what time as all Chriſtians began to be baptized in infancy, (renuing the contract of Chriſtianity, that is, the promiſe of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and the Chief Paſtors acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, for members of the Church, upon that contract, by bleſſing them with Impoſition of Hands) without doubt, it had been, and were, the moſt effectuall mean, to retain, and retrive the ancient Diſcipline of Church. When men might ſee themſelves, by their own ſolemne profeſſion, obliged, to forfeit the communion of the Church, by forfeiting the terms, on which they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to it. If it can thus be ſaid, that Baptiſm is not given without the Biſhop, much more will the ſame be ſaid, of other acts, of the Power of the Keys, whereof that is the firſt. Presbyters have an intereſſe in it, limitable by Canonicall Right, but, as to the Viſible Church, that any man be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, without a Biſhop, is againſt this Rule of the Apoſtles. About Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, divers matters of fact, are in vain alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>Blondell,</hi> and others, from the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Records of the Church, tending to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade Biſhops into the rank of Presbyters.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115786:75"/> If the <hi>Gothes,</hi> from the time of <hi>Valeriane</hi> to the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> for ſome LXX years, (as he conjectureth out of <hi>Philoſtorgius</hi> II. 5.) if the <hi>Scots</hi> before <hi>Palladius,</hi> as <hi>Fordone</hi> III. 8. and <hi>John Maire</hi> II. 2. relate, retained Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity under Presbyters alone, without Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, they had not, in that eſtate, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of governing their own Churches in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but depended on their neighbours, that ordained them thoſe Presbyters, and the Government of the Church among them then muſt be, as now among the <hi>Abaſsines,</hi> where their one Biſhop does nothing but Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain them Presbyters, as <hi>Godignus, ubi ſupra,</hi> relates: And, as the Catholick Chriſtians of <hi>Antiochia</hi> lived, for ſome XXXIV years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the baniſhment of <hi>Euſtathius: Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret. Eccleſ. Hiſt.</hi> I. 21. But, if the <hi>Gothes</hi> had Biſhops before <hi>Vlfitas,</hi> at the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> as he ſhews out of the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories, is any man ſo mad as to grant him, who never endeavours to prove it, that they were made by their own Presbyters, rather then by the neighbour Biſhops of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire, from whence they received Chriſtianity? The Head of a Monaſtery in Aegypt, being a Presbyter, is ſaid, by <hi>Caſsiane, Collat.</hi> IV. 2. to have promoted a Monk whom he loved, to the Prieſthood. Is not this done, by recommending him to his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115786:75"/> for that purpoſe, though he Ordained him not himſelf? The Biſhops of <hi>Durham</hi> and <hi>Lichfield,</hi> are ſaid by <hi>Bede, Eccleſ. Hiſt. Angl.</hi> III. 3, 5. to come from the Monaſtery of <hi>Hy,</hi> governed by a Prieſt. And, it is true, that the Monks of that Monaſtery, having great reputation of holineſſe, ſwaied the Church there. But withall, <hi>Bede</hi> mentions expreſly, the Synod of the Province, and therefore we need ask no further who Ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them Biſhops, knowing, that by the Primitive Rules of the Church, it is the Act of a Synod. Some ſeem to conceive this to be the meaning of the ſuppoſed S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> upon <hi>Eph.</hi> IV. 11. where he ſaith, that, at firſt, the eldeſt of the Presbyters ſucceeded the Biſhop, but that afterwards the courſe was changed, <hi>ut non Ordo ſed meritum crearet Epiſcopum;</hi> which they underſtand thus: That his merit, and not the Bench of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, ſhould make the Biſhop thenceforth; and therefore, that formerly, the Presbyters did it. But this is nothing: For it is plain, that <hi>Ordo</hi> here, ſignifies not the Bench of Presbyters, but a mans Rank in it, according to the time of his promotion to it. Theſe &amp; others of his ſlight Objections, are eaſily wiped away: But there are two, which ſeem to moſt men, to create ſome difficulty. The one is the ninth Canon of the Councell of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115786:76"/> 
                  <hi>Ancyra,</hi> which, if the reading be true which he produces, and <hi>Walo Meſſalinus</hi> preſſes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates plain enough, that City Presbyters might Ordain Presbyters, at that time when it was made: The other is the Antiquities of the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> publiſhed not long ſince, out of <hi>Eutychius</hi> his Hiſtory, who was Patriarch there in his time, and affirms, that from S. <hi>Mark</hi> to <hi>Demetrius,</hi> the Biſhop there, was not only choſen, but Ordained, by Impoſition of the Hands of twelve Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that Church. To the Canon of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyra,</hi> I acknowledge, that the reading which they follow, is, beſide the Copies which they allege, found in a very ancient written one of the Library at <hi>Oxford,</hi> as well as in the old Latine Tranſlation of <hi>Dionyſius Exiguus,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>That it be not lawfull for Country Biſhops, to Ordain Presbyters or Deacons: Nor for the City Presbyters; without leave granted from the Biſhop, by Letters in every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</hi> But I cannot grant this reading to be true, which ſo many circumſtances render queſtionable. Firſt, in an Arabick Paraphraſe, now extant in the ſame Library, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be found of that clauſe, <gap reason="foreign">

Though, for
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115786:77"/> my part, I do not beleeve, that we have the true reading of this Canon, in any Copy, that I have heard of or ſeen: Becauſe the Arabick Paraphraſe aforeſaid, deduces the clauſe of the Country Biſhops at large, that it is not granted them, <hi>Vt faciant Preſbyteros neque Diaconos, omnino, neque in Villa neque in Vrbe, abſque mandato Epiſcopi: Niſi rogatus fuerit Epiſcopus hac de re, &amp; permiſerit eis ut faciant eos, necnon ſcripſerit eis ſcriptum, quod autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem dabit eis eadem de re.</hi> Whereupon, I do beleeve, that the Canon is abridged and curtailed in all Copies, and that the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of it, conſiſts in two clauſes: The firſt, that Country Biſhops Ordain neither Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters nor Deacons, without leave under the Biſhops hand: The ſecond, that the City Presbyters do nothing in the Dioceſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the like leave: Though I undertake not to give you the words of mine own head. As for <hi>Eutychius,</hi> I cannot admit his relation to be Hiſtoricall truth, having forfeited his credit in that part of it, where he ſays, that there were no Biſhops in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> beſide him of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> before <hi>Demetrius.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary whereof appears by <hi>Euſebius, Eccleſ.

                  <hi>the Biſhoprick of the Dioceſes there.</hi> For where there were Dioceſes, there were Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: And if <hi>Demetrius</hi> after <hi>Julian,</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the Dioceſes of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> becauſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> then were there other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopall Churches in that Province, beſides <hi>Alexandria,</hi> before <hi>Demetrius.</hi> Indeed, if there had been no Biſhops under <hi>Alexandria,</hi> it could not reaſonably be avoided, that the Biſhop ſhould be Ordained by the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: Otherwiſe, forein Biſhops, that ſhould be called to Ordain them a Biſhop, muſt, by ſo doing, purchaſe a Power over that Church, which never any can be ſaid to have had, over thoſe Capitall Churches, of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochia, Rome, Alexandria,</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> But, ſuppoſing that there were Biſhops under him of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> it is a greater inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to grant, that their Chief ſhould be made, without their conſent, (which Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation implies, by the often quoted rule of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> V. 22.) by the Presbyters of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> And therefore, when S. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſays, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> LXXXV. that Biſhops were ſet over the Presbyters, by cuſtome of the Church, to avoid Schiſm, becauſe that, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandriae à Marco Evangeliſta uſque ad He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclam &amp; Dionyſium Epiſcopos, Preſbyteri ſemper unum ex ſe electum, in excelſiori gradu collocatum, Epiſcopum nominabant: At Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>

                  <hi>from Mark the Evangeliſt, till Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clas and Dionyſius were Biſhops, the Presbyters were wont to chooſe one of their number, and placing him in a higher degree, named him their Biſhop:</hi> I am not to grant, that he intends by theſe words, that he was Ordained alſo by the Presbyters. For inſtance, <hi>Euſebius, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.

                  </gap>, <hi>Tooke him preſently, and ſet him in the Biſhops Throne:</hi> And yet it cannot be ſaid, that, therefore, the people Ordained him Biſhop. So likewiſe, the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſeated one of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the Biſhops Chair, ſaith S. <hi>Hierome:</hi> This inſtalling, muſt needs have the force of a nomination by the Presbyters, and ſo ſway and prejudice the conſent of the Biſhops aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to the Ordination, (which regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was to be done by a Synod of Biſhops) that their choice was never known to have been void, before the time of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> and <hi>Heraclas,</hi> which was enough to ground S. <hi>Hierome</hi> an argument, though ineffectuall. But ſeeing <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſhews us, that there were other Biſhops in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ſeeing the life of S. <hi>Mark</hi> in <hi>Photius</hi> ſaith, that he planted Churches in <hi>Pentapolis,</hi> (which ſeem to be
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:115786:78"/> thoſe, over which, the authority of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> is eſtabliſhed, by the Councell of <hi>Nice, Can.</hi> IX.) I muſt not grant, that they received their chief from the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> without their own conſent, expreſſed by Impoſition of Hands. This is my opinion of the credit which we are to give to theſe two paſſages, in point of Hiſtoricall truth. But ſuppoſing, not gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them both, I cannot ſee what can be inferred from either of them, prejudiciall to the Order of Biſhops, and the neceſſity thereof, above Presbyters. For ſeeing it is acknowledged, that S. <hi>Mark</hi> Ordained, a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop always to be Head of that Church, and that by virtue of this Ordinance, the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters finde themſelves obliged, to proceed to create one, (which they did ſooner at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> then in other Churches, after the vacancy, ſaith <hi>Epiphanius, Haer.</hi> LXIX. 11.) it is manifeſt, that the authority of a Biſhop, is neceſſary, to the validity of all Acts of the Church, by S. <hi>Marks</hi> Ordinance: when they acknowledge themſelves neceſſitated, to make one, in the firſt place, that the Acts thereof may be valid. Again, as to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> ſuppoſe Presbyters were Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by Presbyters, upon Commiſſion from the Biſhop, is this any prejudice to the Rule, that nothing be done without the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop?
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115786:79"/> Or is it any advantage to them, that would have no Biſhops, and ſo, do all againſt the Biſhop? To my reaſon, it ſeems neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to diſtinguiſh, between the ſolemnity which an Act is executed with, and the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Authority by which it is done. And that it cannot be prejudiciall to any Power, to doe that by another, which ſeemeth not fit, to be immediately and perſonally exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by it: The dependence of the Church being ſafe, by the Commiſſion acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and, the Unity of the Church, by that dependence. Some acts of the Primitive Church, ſeem to require this diſtinction. As, the making of Presbyters, by the <hi>Chore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopi</hi> or Country Biſhops, mentioned in the ancient Greek Canons. Which, by all likelihood, were not properly Biſhops, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not Heads of a City Church, which is the Apoſtolicall Rule, for Epiſcopall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. For, the aforeſaid Arabick Paraphraſe, of the Canon of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> deſcribes them thus: <hi>Interpretatio ejus eſt Epiſcopi Villarum, hoc eſt, Vicarii Epiſcopi per Villas habitatas, qua fuerint in univerſa operatione, id eſt Dioceſi. The meaning of Country Biſhops, is, that they are Biſhops of Villages, that is, the Biſhops Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars, in the beſt inhabited Villages, of all the Dioceſe.</hi> So, it ſeems that they were ſet over the greater Villages, or Bodies of Villages,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115786:79"/> which, in regard of ſome ſecular Right, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to ſome one Village, lying within the Territory of ſome Epiſcopall City. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Councell of <hi>Antiochia</hi> ſaith expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Can.</hi> X. that they and the Countries which they govern, are both ſubject to the Biſhop of the City: Whereupon it ſeems they were Ordained by that one Biſhop, (and, ſo, not properly Biſhops, which are Ordained by a Synod, or the Repreſentatives of it) and that this is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which the Canon there mentions. And this is the reaſon, why they are called <hi>Vicarii Epiſcopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> Biſhops Deputies, in the ancient Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Canons, as you have ſeen. So, if the Canon of <hi>Ancyra</hi> enable them to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain Presbyters within their own precinct, (for that muſt be the meaning of it, when it ſays <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſignifying part of the Territory of the City, aſſigned to their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar care) it ſeems to delegate this Power of the Biſhop, not to be exerciſed, without Letters under his hand and ſeal, as the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non expreſſeth. Again, I ſuppoſe, no man will deny, that all Ordinations in Schiſm are meer nullities, though made by perſons rightly Ordained, becauſe againſt the Unity of the Church. And yet, we finde ſuch Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations made valid, by the meer Decree of the Church, without Ordaining anew. As
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115786:80"/> the <hi>Meletians</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> by the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> in <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories; and, as Pope <hi>Melchiades,</hi> much commended for it by S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> offered, to receive all the Donatiſts in their own ranks, beſides divers others that might be produced. Among which, that expreſſed in the Canons <hi>Antioch.</hi> XIII. <hi>Apoſt.</hi> XXXVI. deſerves to be remembred, whereby, Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made in another Biſhops Dioceſe are made void. For the only reaſon why ſome things, though they be ill done, yet are to ſtand good, is, becauſe the Power that doth them extendeth to them, but is ill uſed. So, when the Power is uſurped, as in all Schiſm, or when that is done, which the Law makes void, it can be to no effect. Therefore, when the act of Schiſm is made valid, it is manifeſt, that the Order of Biſhop &amp; Presbyter, is conferred, in point of Right, by the meer conſent of the Church, which, by the precedent Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was conferred only in point of Fact, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a meer nullity in point of Right. Adde hereunto, that of the Apoſtolicall Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions VIII. 27. that a Biſhop may be Ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by one Biſhop, being inabled by an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the reſt of the Province, when they cannot aſſemble, in caſe of perſecution, or the like. For, here, the Power is derived from all, though the ſolemnity be executed
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115786:80"/> by one. By the ſame reaſon it is, that Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> was done by the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: As the ſuppoſed S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> upon <hi>Eph.</hi> IV. (agreeing with the Author of the <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions in Vet. &amp; Novum Teſtam. Quaeſt.</hi> CI. among S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Works) witneſſeth: For that is it, which the one of them means by <hi>conſignant,</hi> the other by <hi>conſecrat,</hi> becauſe both limit their aſſertion, that it was onely done in the abſence of the Biſhop Which cannot be ſuppoſed at Ordinations, becauſe they were regularly to be made at a Synod of Biſhops. For, ſeeing it was done onely in the abſence of the Biſhop, by conſequence, it was done by Order and Commiſſion from the Biſhop, by which the cuſtome was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. And therefore, cannot be prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to that Power, by virtue whereof it was done, as by authority derived from it. And, to my underſtanding, this is the reaſon of that which we finde done <hi>Acts</hi> XIII. 1—where, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> being Ordained, by the immediate act of the Holy Ghoſt, to Preach to the Gentiles, the ſolemnity thereof is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by thoſe, in whom we cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, the Power of ſending them to reſt. In which opinion I am much confirmed, by the practice of the Synagogue. For, though it is manifeſt, that the cuſtome of promoting Judges by Impoſition of Hands, came from
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115786:81"/> the example of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Ordaining of the LXX Elders, and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> yet we muſt beleeve their Records, compiled by <hi>Maimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>. de Synedrio, cap.</hi> IV. when they tell us, that, in proceſſe of time, it was done without that ſolemnity, by an Inſtrument, or ſo, and yet, ſtill called, nevertheleſſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>Impoſition of Hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, let them that demand, what is that ſpeciall Act, which Biſhops are able to do, and Presbyters not, take their choice. If they be content, that, the Biſhops acting with this Intereſſe, that without him nothing be done, be counted a ſpeciall Act, they have the ſpeciall Act which they demand, in all things that are done in the Church. If they be not, though it is eaſie enough to diſpute it everlaſtingly, yet I will not contend with them about it, ſeeing it is enough, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is done without him, to make him a fair ſtep above his Presbyters. And yet, I conceive, there is an Act to be named, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Biſhops, which is, to ſit in a Councell. Which, conſiſting of the repreſentatives of all Churches, and not capable of all Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the Biſhops right being, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him nothing be done in his Church, it follows, that, by the right, by which he is a Biſhop, he is a member of his Synod, which no Prieſt can be, but by Privilege, ſeeing
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115786:81"/> the whole Order cannot. And this according to the Scriptures. For, by the premiſes, the Apoſtles had place in the Councell at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> as Ordinary Governours of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches concerned in it, which Churches, had there no other repreſentatives but <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> (as Heads of the Churches, which they had founded ſo lately, <hi>Acts</hi> XIII. XIV.) as it appeares, when, by them, the Decree is delivered to executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Churches, <hi>Acts</hi> XVI. 4. As for the Presbyters mentioned in it, the ſame evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which aſſures us that they were Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, aſſures us alſo, that they were Presbyters of the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and none elſe. This I conceive the fitteſt, to be thought the ſpeciall Act of a Biſhop. For, the unity of the whole Church, ariſes from the Power, depoſited in each Church: By virtue whereof, he that communicates with any one Church, in any rank of it, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates with all Churches in the ſame. Which, was in the Primitive Church, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the <hi>literae formatae,</hi> or, <hi>letters of mark,</hi> by which, this Unity of the Ancient Church was maintained, in as much as, he that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled with ſuch a teſtimony, of his rank in any one Church, by virtue of the ſame, was received, in all Churches where he came. And therefore <hi>Syneſius,</hi> in the ſentence of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115786:82"/> excommunication againſt <hi>Andronicus,</hi> which, by his fifty ſeventh Epiſtle, he publiſheth to the Churches, addeth, that if any Church, contemning the ſentence of his Church, as a ſmall and a poor one, ſhould receive <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieus</hi> to communion, without ſatisfaction gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him and his Church, thereby it ſhall become guilty of Schiſm. This holds, as ſuch Acts are not queſtioned by any greater part of the Church, as not concerning the State of other Churches. Which if they be, then, as no Church, can be concluded but by the Act to which themſelves concur, (whereby, all Excommunications, &amp; Ordinations, as wel as making of Canons, are the ſubject of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods) ſo, the chief Power, muſt needs be moſt ſeen, in that Act which concludes all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches concerned, which is the Act of a Synod.</p>
               <p>As concerning the objection, that there is no precept in the Scripture, that Biſhops govern all Churches, and that many things Ordained by the Apoſtles, are aboliſhed in the Church: It is a queſtion, whether it come from leſſe skill, or proceed to worſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: For, unleſſe we will betray the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the Church, to very many, and perhaps, to all Hereſies and Schiſms that ever were, we muſt confeſſe, that, as there are precepts in the Scripture, that oblige not, ſo there are many things, not ſet down
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:115786:82"/> in the Scripture in the form of precepts, that oblige. What can be delivered, in a more expreſſe form of precept, then that of Saint <hi>Paul, That women pray with their heads cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, men with theirs uncovered;</hi> and yet, where is it in force? The ſame is to be ſaid of the Decree of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> againſt eating things ſtrangled and blood. On the other ſide, we finde by the Scriptures, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles kept the Lords Day, but do not find there, that they commanded it to be kept: As for the fourth Commandement, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it is one thing to reſt on the day that God ceaſed his work, and another, on the day that he began it. And, if there be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts in the Scripture, that now oblige not, why may not <hi>Secinus</hi> diſpute, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Baptiſm was temporary, for them, that had been enemies to the Faith afore? And though I ſay not that he ſhall have the better hand, (for the truth cannot be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the truth) yet, it ſhall not be poſſible, for every Chriſtian to diſcern, whether he hath it or no, unleſſe there be ſome more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ballaſt, then nice conſequences from the Text of the Scripture. If it be thus of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, much more of the Euchariſt, which, as you ſaw, is not uſed any more in the Church, as it was inſtituted. As for the Power of the Keys, it is, abſolutely, by this
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115786:83"/> anſwer, betraied to the Socinians, who would have it peculiar to the Apoſtles: For, it is no where delivered as a Precept, but onely as a Privilege. What means is there then to end everlaſting difficulties? Surely, the ſame that there is, to underſtand all poſitive Laws that ever were. For if the ancient interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the practice of any Law, ſecure the Church, that it was not given to all times and places, ſure, that which is not mentioned as a Precept, and yet has been always in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, without interruption, as it was in force afore it was mentioned, ſo was intended to oblige, not by the mention, but by the act that firſt eſtabliſhed it, evidenced by practice. Which if it be ſo, then is there no Power on earth, able to aboliſh the Order of Biſhops, having been in force, in all Churches, ever ſince the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>I muſt not paſſe this place of limiting all Intereſts, without a word or two, of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Deacons in the Church. In regard of two extreme opinions, one of <hi>Geneva,</hi> that makes them meer Lay men, collectors of Alms, by neceſſary conſequence, becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Lay Elders; the other of ſome, that would have them underſtood to be Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as oft as S. <hi>Paul</hi> mentions but two Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Biſhops and Deacons, <hi>Phil.</hi> I. 1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> II. 9. But as the Apoſtles were at firſt
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:115786:83"/> their own Deacons, before the Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them ſome to wait on them, and yet their whole function was then holy, though ſome parts of it, nearer to the end of the ſouls health: So, when Deacons were made, reaſon inforces, that they ſhould attend on the meaneſt part of the Office of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but always on holy duties. For, the Tables which the Apoſtles ſaw firſt furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed themſelves, but were attended by the Deacons in doing it, when they were made, were the ſame, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XI. 20—which the Euchariſt was ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated at, as the cuſtome was daily to doe at <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> II. 42, 46. and therefore, their office, by this, was the ſame then, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways it hath been ſince, to wait upon the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the Euchariſt. Secondly, I have ſhewed afore, that even the Apoſtles and their followers the Evangeliſts, were alſo Deacons, with as much difference, as there is between the perſons whom they ſerved, that is, between our Lord and his Apoſtles on one ſide, and the Biſhop and Presbyters of a Church on the other. Whereupon the Miniſters of Biſhops and Presbyters, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Deacons abſolutely, and the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, without any addition, ſignifies, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute a Deacons Office, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> III 10. But the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts are called Deacons,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115786:84"/> with additions, ſignifying, whoſe Miniſters, or to what ſpeciall purpoſe, as hath been ſaid. Thirdly, when S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>They that doe the office of a Deacon well, purchaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a good ſtep,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> II. 13. <hi>Clemens A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandrinus,</hi> and the practice of the Church, interprets this ſtep, to be the rank of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters: Therefore they were in the next de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to it afore. Fourthly, it hath been ſhewed, that they ſate not, but ſtood in the Church, as attending the Biſhop and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters ſitting, and yet were imploied in the Offices of Preaching and Baptizing. And accordingly, in the Primitive Church, a great part of the Service, reading Leſſons, ſinging Pſalms, and ſome part of the Prayers, were miniſtred by them, as I have ſhewed in the Apoſtolicall form of Divine Service, <hi>cap.</hi> X. Which held correſpondently in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue. For, the Miniſters and Apparitors of their Conſiſtories, were alſo their Deacons, and miniſtred Divien Service in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue. Whereby it appears, to be the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Apoſtles, that the younger ſort of thoſe that dedicated themſelves to the ſervice of the Church, ſhould be trained up in the ſervice of the Biſhop and Presbyters, as well to the underſtanding of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as to the right exerciſe of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Offices, that, in their time, ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:115786:84"/> capable, might come to govern in the Church themſelves.</p>
               <p>That which remains, concerning the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſe of the People in the Church, will be eaſily diſcharged, if we remember, that it muſt be ſuch, as may not prejudice, either the dependence of Churches, or the Chief Power of the Biſhop, with the Presbyters, in each particular Church. The Law of the XII Tables, <hi>Salus populi ſuprema lex eſto,</hi> though it were made for a popular State, not for a Kingdome, yet admits a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>populus</hi> and <hi>plebs:</hi> and requires the chief Rule to be, the good, both of Senate and Commons, not of one part alone. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that which is ſaid, in the Scriptures, to have been done by the Church, muſt not therefore be imagined, to be done by the People: Becauſe the Church conſiſts of two parts, called by <hi>Tertullian O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>do</hi> and <hi>Plebs,</hi> in the terms of latter times, the Clergy and People, but preſerving the reſpective Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of Clergy and People. In the choice of <hi>Matthias</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>They ſet two, Acts</hi> I. 23. what <hi>they,</hi> but the Church? in which the People, were then better Chriſtians, then to abridge the Apoſtles, but, proportionably, they are always to reſpect the Biſhop and Presbyters, if they will obey the Apoſtles, that command it, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> V. 12, 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> XIII.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115786:85"/> 7, 17. So, when S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>Doe not ye judge thoſe that are within,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> V. 12. ſpeaks he to the People, or to the Church, that is, to the Bench of Presbyters, and the People, in their ſeverall intereſts, and that, not without dependence upon the Apoſtles? The words of our Lord <hi>Dic Eccleſiae, Mat.</hi> XVIII. 18. make much noiſe. At the end of my Book, of the Apoſtolicall form of Divine Service, <hi>p.</hi> 428<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you have a paſſage of S. <hi>Auguſtine, Cont. Epiſt. Parmen</hi> III. 2. that Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is the ſentence of the Church. And yet, I ſuppoſe, no man hath the confidence to diſpute, that in S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> time, it was the ſentence of the People. So, the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of <hi>Andronicus,</hi> in <hi>Syneſius</hi> his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and fiftieth Epiſtle, is intitled to the Church, yet no man imagines that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple then did excommunicate. Is not the caſe the ſame in the Synagogue? <hi>Moſes</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>ſpeak to the Congregation of the children of Iſrael, and he ſpeaks to the Elders, Exod.</hi> XII. 2, 25. does <hi>Moſes</hi> diſobey God in ſo doing, or, does he underſtand the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, better then this opinion would have him, in ſpeaking to the Elders, who, he knew, were to act on behalf of the People? The Law commands <hi>the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to offer for ignorance, Lev.</hi> IV. 13, 14. <hi>Num.</hi> XV. 22, 24. how ſhall all the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115786:85"/> offer? <hi>Maimoni</hi> anſwers in the Title of Errors, <hi>cap.</hi> XII. <hi>&amp;</hi> XIII. that the great Conſiſtory offers, as often as they occaſion the breach of the Law, by Teaching, that is, interpreting it erroneouſly. In the Law of the Cities of Refuge, it is ſaid, <hi>The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation ſhall judge,</hi> and <hi>the Congregation ſhall deliver the manſlayer, Num.</hi> XXXV. 35, 36. The Elders of the City of Refuge were to judge, in preſence, and in behalf of the People, whether the manſlayer was capable of the privilege of the City of Refuge, or not, as you reade <hi>Joſhua</hi> XX. 4, 6. ſeeing then, that theſe things, being done by the Elders, are ſaid to be done by the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, or Aſſembly of the People, in behalf of whom they are done, is it a wrong to the Scriptures, when we ſay, that which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to be done by the Church, was acted by the chief power of the Apoſtles and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, with conſent of the People? For it is manifeſt in the Scriptures, that, in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles times, all publique Acts of the Church, were paſſed at the publique Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the ſame, as Ordinations, <hi>Acts</hi> I. 23. VI. 3, 6. Excommunications, <hi>Mat.</hi> XVIII. 18, 19, 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> V. 4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> II. 10. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, <hi>Acts</hi> XV. 4, 27. Other Acts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> VIII. 19. And herewith agrees the Primitive cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Church, for divers ages, to be
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115786:86"/> ſeen in a little Diſcourſe of the Learned <hi>Blondell, Of the Right of the People in the Church,</hi> publiſhed of late. And can this be thought to no purpoſe, unleſſe it diſſolve the Unity of the Church, or that obedience to the Clergy, which God commandeth? Is it nothing, to give ſatisfaction to the People, of the integrity of the proceedings of the Church, and by the ſame mean, to oblige ſuperiours to that integrity, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the proceedings manifeſt, and ſo to preſerve the Unity of the Church? I ſay not, that theſe times are capable of ſuch ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, upon the like terms, as them: But from this practice under the Apoſtles, I ſhall eaſily grant the people an Intereſſe, in ſuch things as may concern their particular Congregations, of excepting againſt ſuch proceedings, as can appear to them, to be againſt any Rule of the Scripture, or of the whole Church. For, this Intereſſe it is, upon which, the people is demanded, in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> what they have to ſay, againſt Ordinations and Mariages to be made. And if their ſatisfaction, in matter of Penance, were to be returned, it would be no more then the ſame reaſon inferres. Eſpecially, becauſe it hath been ſhewed, that the prayers of the People, or of the Church, is one part of the means, to take
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115786:86"/> away ſinne by the Keys of the Church, the other being the Humiliation of the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, according to that Order, and meaſure which the Biſhop and Presbyters ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, <hi>James</hi> V. 14, 15. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> XII. 20, 21. <hi>Mat.</hi> XVIII. 21. 1 <hi>John</hi> V. 16. And if this Intereſſe were made effectuall, by the Laws of Chriſtian States and Kingdomes, to the hindrance of ſuch proceedings, wherein the Power of the Church may be abuſed, the Church ſhall have no cauſe to complain. But, that the Power ſhould be taken from the Church, becauſe the Laws of the State are not ſo good as they might be, is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and pernicious a medicine, as to put the Chief Power in the hands of the People. For, ſeeing it hath been demonſtrated, that, as it was the cuſtome to paſſe ſuch Acts, at the Aſſemblies of the whole Church, ſo was it alſo, to adviſe and reſolve upon them, at the Conſiſtories of the Clergy, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that the ſuffrage of the People, often mentioned in Church Writers, was not to reſolve, but to paſſe what was reſolved afore, becauſe nothing appeared in barre to it. For, the Intereſſe of the People extending no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then their own Church, and it being impoſſible, that all the Chriſtians, within the Territories of Cities, belonging to the reſpective Churches, ſhould all aſſemble at
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115786:87"/> once, it is manifeſt, none of theſe matters could be reſolved by number of Votes, and therefore, that the Power was not in the People, but a Right, to be ſatisfied, of the right uſe of the Power, by thoſe that had it: Which, how it may be made effectuall, to the benefit of the People, in a Chriſtian Church and State, is not for me to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. But by virtue of this Right it is, that, (as <hi>Juſtellus,</hi> in his Notes upon the Greek and Africane Canons, hath obſerved to us, eſpecially out of the Records of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Africk, and of the Weſt) for divers Ages, the Beſt of the People, who, as he ſhews, were called <hi>Seniores &amp; Preſbyteri Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiarum,</hi> were admitted to aſſiſt, at the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the publique Acts of thoſe Churches. In all which, as there is nothing to be found like the Power of the Keys, which Lay El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are created to manage: So, he that will conſider the intereſſe, in which, it appears they did intervene, comparing it with the intolerable trouble, which the concurrence of the People was found to breed when the number of Chriſtians was increaſed, by the Emperours profeſſing Chriſtianity, will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge, that it was nothing elſe, but the Intereſſe of the People, which, in ſucceeding ages, was referred to ſome perſons choſen out of them, to manage, in the publique Acts
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115786:87"/> of the Church. And this cuſtome is ſutable enough, with the Office of Church-wardens in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if it had been eſtabliſhed, as well in the Mother, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall, as in the Pariſh Churches.</p>

               <p>THeſe things thus determined, and the whole Power of the Church thus li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, in Biſhops and Presbyters, with reſervation of the Intereſſe of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſpecified, it follows neceſſarily, that no Secular perſon whatſoever, endowed with Soveraign or ſubordinate Power, in any State, is thereby endowed with any part of this Eccleſiaſticall Power, hitherto deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. Becauſe it hath been premiſed for a Principle, here to be reaſſumed, that no State, by profeſſing Chriſtianity, and the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, can purchaſe to it ſelf, or defeat the Church of any part of the Right, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115786:88"/> it ſtands poſſeſſed, by the Originall inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of our Lord and his Apoſtles; and therefore no perſon, indowed with any qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſubſiſting by the Conſtitution of any State, can challenge any Right, that ſubſiſteth by the Conſtitution of the Church, and therefore belongeth to ſome perſon qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſame. For, Eccleſiaſticall Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I underſtand here, to be onely that, which ſubſiſteth by the Conſtitution of the Church; And therefore all by Divine Right, to all that acknowledge, no humane authority, capable of founding the Church: And therefore, by Divine Right, inveſted in the Perſons of them that have received it, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately or immediately, from the Apoſtles: (ſeeing it is no ways imaginable, how any man can ſtand lawfully poſſeſſed of that Power, which is effectually in ſome body elſe, from whom he claimeth not:) And therefore not to be propagated, but by the free act of them that ſo have it. But I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not hereby, to exclude Secular Powers, from their Right in Church matters: But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to diſtinguiſh between Eccleſiaſticall Power, and Power in Eccleſiaſticall matters: and theſe to diſtinguiſh, by the originall, from whence they both proceed, becauſe, ſo, we ſhall be beſt able, to make an eſtimate of the effect, which both of them are able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:115786:88"/> according to the ſaying obſerved afore, that the water riſes no higher then it deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded afore. For, if, by Eccleſiaſticall Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, we mean that, which ariſes from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Church, it is not poſſible, that by any quality, not depending on the ſame, any man ſhould be inabled to any act that doth. But if Power in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, be a Power neceſſary, to the ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of all States, then have Chriſtian States, that Power in the diſpoſing of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, which all States in generall have, in the diſpoſing of thoſe things, which concern that Religion which they ſuppoſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe. And, this to prove, I will not be much beholding to the Records of Hiſtories, or to the opinions and reaſons of Philoſophers: Seeing common ſenſe alone is able to ſhew us, that there is not any State, profeſſing any Religion, that does not exerciſe an intereſſe, in diſpoſing of matters of Religion, as they have relation, to the publique peace, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, and happineſſe of that people. The Power of diſpoſing in matters of Religion, is one part, and that a very conſiderable one, of that publique Power, wherein Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſiſts, which ſubordinate Powers enjoy not, by any title, but as derived from the Soveraign. Wherefore, having premiſed for a principle in the beginning, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:115786:89"/> makes no alteration in the ſtate of civile Societies, but eſtabliſhes all, in the ſame Right, whereof they ſtand poſſeſt, when they come to imbrace Chriſtianity, I muſt inferre, that the publique Powers of Chriſtian States, have as good Right, to the diſpoſing of matters of Chriſtianity, (ſo that, according to the inſtitution of Chriſt, nothing, done by the Church, may prove prejudiciall to the State) as any Soveraign Power, that is not Chriſtian, hath, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of matters of that Religion which they profeſſe. For, ſeeing it is part of the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, to confirm and eſtabliſh, not to queſtion or unſettle, any thing, which is done by civile Juſtice in any State, whatſoever ſecular Powers ſhall doe, towards maintaining the State of this world in tranquillity, cannot be prejudiciall to Chriſtianity rightly underſtood: Neither can it be true Chriſtianity, which cannot ſtand with the courſe of true civile Juſtice. It hath been effectually proved, by Church Writers, againſt the Gentiles, that, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them not to beleeve the Chriſtian Faith, notwithſtanding, they cannot, with civile Juſtice, perſecute the Chriſtians. And all upon this ſcore, that Chriſtianity containeth nothing prejudiciall to civile Society, but all advantageous. But though the Chriſtian
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:115786:89"/> Religion be grounded upon truth indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from God, yet Religion; in generall, is a morall virtue, and part of the profeſſion of all civile Nations: In ſo much as, that people, which ſhould profeſſe to fear no God, would thereby put themſelves out of the protection of the Law of Nations, and give all civile people a Right and Title, to ſeek to ſubdue them, for their good, and to conſtrain them to that, which the light of nature is able to demonſtrate, to be both true and due. For, how can any of them expect Faith and Troth in civile commerce; from them that acknowledge no reaſon for it? Or how can they be thought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any reaſon for it, that acknowledge no God to puniſh the contrary? Or how can they be but enemies of mankinde, from whom that cannot be expected? But, in Chriſtianity, there is that particularity which I declared afore, that God hath declared his will and pleaſure to be, that it be received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the protection of all Kingdomes and Commonwealths. Wherefore, it is further the will of God, that ſecular Powers, that are Chriſtian, act in the protection of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, not onely as ſecular Powers, but as Chriſtians: And, by conſequence, that they hold themſelves obliged to the maintenance of all parts of Chriſtianity: That is, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:115786:90"/> is of Divine Right, in the Profeſſion and Exerciſe of it. But, it is very well ſaid otherwiſe, that, this whole Right of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Powers in Eccleſiaſticall matters, is not deſtructive, but cumulative: That is, that it is not able to defeat, or aboliſh any part of that Power, which, by the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, is ſetled upon Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical perſons, but ſtands obliged to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and protection of it. For, ſeeing this Power, in the perſons endowed with it by the Conſtitution of the Church, is a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of that Right, which God hath eſtabliſhed in his Church, it follows neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, that no Power, ordained to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of all parts thereof, can extinguiſh this. And truly, he that adviſes but with his own common ſenſe, ſhall eaſily perceive, that, Eccleſiaſticall Power may be able to preſerve Order and Diſcipline in the Church, by it ſelf, ſo long as the World, that is, <hi>the State</hi> profeſſes not Chriſtianity, as we ſee it was, before the Romane Empire was Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: But, when the State profeſſes Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, it cannot be imagined, that, perſons qualified by the State, will ever willingly ſubmit, to acknowledge, and ratifie the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Church, in all the acts and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings thereof, unleſſe the coactive Power of the Soveraign inforce it. All States there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115786:90"/> have Soveraign Power, as well in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Chriſtian Religion as in other points of Soveraignty; That is, they are able to do all acts of Soveraign Power, in Church mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: To give Laws, as well concerning mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, as civile affairs: To exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Juriſdiction, about Eccleſiaſticall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: To Command in the ſame, which ſeems to be the moſt eminent act of Soveraignty, ſeeing, that giving of Laws, and Juriſdiction, are but particulars of that generall, the one, that is, giving Laws, in Generals, the other that is Juriſdiction, in particular cauſes: And both of them tending to limit that Power, of Command or Empire, which, otherwiſe, is abſolute, in the diſpoſition and will of the Soveraign. And therefore, the moſt civile people that ever was, the Romanes, have denominated Soveraignty, by this act of Command, <hi>Imperium,</hi> or <hi>Empire.</hi> But, all theſe acts of Soveraign Power in Church matters, being diſtinguiſhed from the like acts of Eccleſiaſticall Power, not by their materiall, but formall objects, that is, not by the Things, Perſons, or Cauſes, in which, but by the reaſons, upon which, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, to which they are exerciſed, muſt needs leave the Powers of the Church, intire, to all purpoſes, as it finds the ſame, in thoſe that have it, by the conſtitutions of the Church.</p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:115786:91"/>
               <p> Here are two Points of the Power of the Church, to be ſetled, before we go any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Not becauſe of any affinity, or depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, between them, but becauſe the reaſon is the ſame, which cauſes the difficulty in both. Whether there be an Originall Power in the Church, to give Laws, as to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the Church: Whether there be an Originall Right in the Church, to Tithes, Oblations, Firſt-fruits, and generally, to all conſecrate things, ſeems to moſt men, more then diſputable, becauſe, the acceſſory acts of ſecular Powers, (which, in all Chriſtian States, have made the Laws, by which Chriſtianity is exerciſed, the Laws of thoſe ſeverall States, have eſtabliſhed the endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church upon it, by that coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Power, which they onely in Chief are endowed with) being moſt viſible to common ſenſe, ſeem to have obſcured the Originall Right of the Church, in both particulars. Over and beſides all this, thoſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, deny the Church all Power of giving Laws, Rules, Canons, or, however you pleaſe to call them, to the Church: For, to this purpoſe, they make all Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons abſolute and Soveraign, that nothing be done in the Church, without the conſent of every member of it. Not acknowledging ſo much as that Rule, which all humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115786:91"/> beſides acknowledges, the whole to be bound by the act of the greater part: But requiring, that every mans conſcience be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, in every thing that the Church does, unleſſe ſome happily appear wilfull, whom, by way of penalty, they neglect for that time. As for thoſe of the Presbyteries, I cannot deny that they grant the Church this Power: But, it ſeems, upon condition that it may reſt in themſelves: For, to the Laws of this Church, in which they received and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſtianity, they oppoſe the ſaying of the Apoſtle, that it ſtands not with chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for the Church to injoin any thing, which weak conſciences may be offended at: And that of our Lord, that this would be will-worſhip, and ſerving of God according to humane traditions, which are all the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which thoſe of the Congregations allege for their opinion, ſo farre as I can learn. It will be, therefore, worth the while, to conſider the caſes, which the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides, upon that principle, though I have done it in part already, in my larger Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, <hi>p.</hi> 309. for, ſo long as the caſe is not underſtood, in which the Apoſtle alleges it, no marvell, if it be brought to prove that, which he never intended by it. We know he reſolves, both the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> by this ſentence: With the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:115786:92"/> the caſe was concerning the eating of things ſacrificed to Idols: which, the Apoſtle ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly diſtinguiſhes, that it may be done two ways, materially, and formally: mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially, when a man eats it <hi>as a creature of God, giving him thanks for it;</hi> which the Apoſtle therefore determines to be agreeable to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> VIII. 7. formally, when a man eats it <hi>with conſcience of the Idoll, as a thing ſacrificed to it,</hi> as the Apoſtle expreſſes it, that is, with a religious reſpect to it, which, therefore, he ſhews at large to be Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> X. 7, 14—Wherefore, though things ſacrificed to Idols, be as free for Chriſtians to eat, as any men elſe, yet, in ſome caſes, and circumſtances, it ſo fell out, that a Chriſtian, eating with a Gentile, of their Sacrifices, (the remains whereof, were the cheer, which they feaſted upon, and their Feaſts, part of the Religion, which they ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Idols with) might be thought, by a weak Chriſtian, to hold their Sacrificing, as indifferent, as their meat, and he that thus thought, be induced, to eat them, formally, as things offered to Idols: As eating them in the Temples of Idols, or, at a Feaſt made by a Gentile, upon occaſion of ſome Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> VIII. 10. X. 27. In this caſe, the Apoſtle determines, that charity requires a Chriſtian, to forbear the uſe of his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:115786:92"/> when the uſe of it, may occaſion a weak Chriſtian, to fall into miſpriſion of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry. But, among the <hi>Romanes,</hi> the caſe which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to, was between Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians converted from Jews, and from Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; as appears by the particulars, which he mentions to be ſcrupled at, to wit, <hi>days and meats, kom.</hi> XIV. 2, 5. and the offence likely thereby to come to paſſe, this, that Jewiſh Chriſtians, ſeeing the Heatheniſh eat things forbidden by the Law, (and, perhaps, among the reſt things ſacrificed to Idols, forbidden, not by the letter of the Law, but by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation and determination of it, in force, by the authority of the Synagogue, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory) might imagine, that Chriſtians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the Law of God, and, by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the God of the Law, and ſo, out of zeal to the true God, fall from Chriſtianity and periſh: For this is, manifeſtly, the offence, and ſtumbling, which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, <hi>Rom.</hi> XIV. 13, 15, 20. as I have ſhewed out of <hi>Origen,</hi> in the place afore quoted. Here is then the ſentence of the Apoſtle, that, when the uſe of thoſe things, wherein Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are not limited by the Law of God, becomes an occaſion of falling into ſin, to thoſe that underſtand not the reaſon, of the freedome of Chriſtians, charity requires a Chriſtian, to forbear the uſe of this freedom.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:115786:93"/> From whence, who ſo inferres, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, no Eccleſiaſticall Law can be of force, when it meets with a weak conſcience, and therefore never, becauſe it may always meet with ſuch, will conclude the contrary of the Apoſtles meaning. For, when Chriſtianity makes all things free to a Chriſtian, that are not limited by Gods Law, it makes not the uſe of this freedome neceſſary to Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Apoſtle ſaying expreſly, that <hi>the Kingdome of God is not meat and drink, Rom.</hi> XIV. 17. by conſequence, not the obſerving, or not obſerving of days: That is, conſiſts no more, in not eating, or not obſerving days, then in eating, &amp; in obſerving them. So that, as he, that ſubmits unto the Law of charity, muſt forbear his freedome once, and as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as the uſe of it miniſtreth offence, ſo for the ſame reaſon, muſt he always forbear the uſe of it, whenſoever the uſe of it comes to be reſtrained, though not by Gods Law, yet by the Law of the Church: Becauſe the greateſt offence, the greateſt breach of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to call in queſtion, the Order eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the Church, in the preſervation whereof, the Unity of the Church conſiſteth. Whereunto thus much may be added, that, as the things that are determined by the Canons of the Church, are not determined by Gods Law, as to the ſpecies of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:115786:93"/> and ſubject of them, yet, as to the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from whence the determination of them may proceed, they may be ſaid to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by Gods Law, in as much as by Gods Law that authority is eſtabliſhed, by which thoſe things are determinable, which the good Order and Unity of the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to be determined. The evidence of which authority, is as expreſſe in Gods Book, as it can be in any Book inſpired by God. Thoſe of the Congregations indeed, betake themſelves here, to a Fort, which, they think, cannot be approached, when they ſay, that, what is written in the Scripture, is revealed from above, and therefore, the Laws that are there recorded, are no precedents to the Church, to uſe the like right. For, it is manifeſt, by the Scriptures of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, that there were many Laws, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, Conſtitutions, or what you pleaſe to call them, in force at that time, which no Scripture can ſhew, to have been comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by revelation from God, as the Law of God. <hi>Daniel</hi> forbore the Kings meat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, a portion of it, was ſacrificed to their Idols, dedicating the whole to the honour of the ſame: That is, he forbore to eate things ſacrificed to Idols materially. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that Order which we ſee was afterwards in force among the Jews, was then in uſe and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115786:94"/> practice: Not by the written Law of God; therefore by the determination of thoſe, whom the Law gave Power to determine ſuch matters. The Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> reckons up many circumſtances, and ceremonies, of the Jews publick Faſts and Humiliations, <hi>Joel</hi> II. 15, 16, 17. which are ſo farre from being commanded by the law, that the Jews Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors confeſſe, there is no further Order, for any Faſts, in the Law, then that which they draw, by a conſequence far enough fetched, out of <hi>Num.</hi> X. 9. where Order is given for making the Trumpets, which, they ſay, and the Prophet ſuppoſes, that their Faſts were proclaimed with. <hi>Maimoni, Tit. Taanith, cap.</hi> I. In another Prophet, <hi>Zac.</hi> VII. 3. VIII. 19. it appears, that there were ſet Faſts which they were bound to ſolemnize every year, on the fourth, fifth, ſeventh and tenth moneths: As alſo it appears by the words of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee, <hi>Luc.</hi> XVIII. 12. that, the Mundays and Thurſdays, were then, and before then, obſerved by the Jews, as ſince they have been: And, as you ſee the like done, in the Feaſt of <hi>Lots,</hi> ordained in <hi>Eſthers</hi> time; and, that of the Dedication, in <hi>Judas Maccabcus</hi> his; And, in the ſame Prophet, <hi>Zac.</hi> XII. 12, 13, 14. you have a manifeſt alluſion, to the Jews ceremonies, at their Funerals, recorded by <hi>Maimont</hi> in the title of Mourners, <hi>cap.</hi> IX.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115786:94"/> clearly ſhewing, that they were in force in that Prophets time: As it is manifeſt, that they began, before the Law it ſelf, not only by that which we reade of the Funerals of <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> but chiefly, becauſe it required an expreſſe Law of God, to derogate from it, as to the Prieſts, in the caſe of <hi>Aarons</hi> ſons, <hi>Levit.</hi> X. 6. XXI. 1, 10, 11, 12. Many more there are to be obſerved in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if theſe were not enough to evidence, that which cannot be denied, that it appears indeed by Scripture, that there were ſuch Laws in force, but that they were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by revelations from God, is quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing: Though men of learning, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, make themſelves ridiculous, by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, as if all that is recorded in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, were commanded by God, when, all that comes from God, is, the record of them, as true, not the authority of them, as divine. The caſe is not much otherwiſe in the New Teſtament, where, it is manifeſt, that many Conſtitutions, Ordinances, or Traditions, (as the Apoſtle ſometimes calls them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XI. 2.) are recorded, which no man can ſay, that they obliged not the Church; and yet, this force of binding the Church, comes not from the mention of them, which we finde, in ſeverall places of Scripture; (For, they muſt needs be in force,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115786:95"/> before they could be mentioned, as ſuch, in the Scriptures) but, from that Power, which God had appointed, to order and determine ſuch things, in his Church. This difference indeed there is between the Old and New Teſtament, that this, being all written in the Apoſtles time, can mention nothing of that nature, but that, which, comming from the Apoſtles, might come by immediate revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God: Which of the Old cannot be ſaid. For, though there were Prophets, in all ages of it, and thoſe Prophets endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch truſt, that if they commanded to diſpenſe with any of Gods own poſitive Laws, they were to be obeyed, as appears by <hi>Elias,</hi> commanding to Sacrifice in Mount <hi>Carmell,</hi> contrary to the Law of <hi>Levit.</hi> XVII. 4. (and this, by virtue of the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> XVIII. 18, 19. becauſe, he that gave the Law by <hi>Moſes,</hi> might, by another, as well diſpenſe with it) yet it is manifeſtly certain, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, they had not the power of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thoſe Conſtitutions, which were to bind the people, in the exerciſe of their Religion, according to the Law. For, when the Law, makes them ſubject, to be judged by the Conſiſtory, whether true Prophets or not; (whereupon, we ſee, that they were many times perſecuted, and our Lord, at laſt put to death, by them, that would not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115786:95"/> them, becauſe they had not the grace to obey them, as you ſaw afore;) it cannot be imagined, that they were enabled, to any ſuch act of government, as giving thoſe Laws to the Synagogue. Eſpecially, ſeeing, by the Law, of <hi>Deut.</hi> XVII. 8-12. this power, and this right, is manifeſtly ſetled upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory. For ſeeing, that, by the Law, all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions ariſing about the Law, are remitted to the place of Gods worſhip, where the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory ſate in all ages; and, the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a caſe doubtfull in Law, to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under pain of death, is, manifeſtly, a Law which all are obliged to live by: of neceſſity therefore, thoſe who have power to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what the written Law had not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, doe give Law to the people. And this right, our Lord himſelf, who, as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, had right to reprove even the publick government, where it was amiſſe, eſtabliſhes, as ready to maintain them in it, had they ſubmitted to the Goſpel, when he ſays, <hi>Mat.</hi> XXIII. 2. <hi>The Scribes and Phariſees ſit in Moſes Chair, all therefore that they teach you obſerve and doe:</hi> The Scribes and Phariſees, being, either limbs and members, or appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the Conſiſtory, who, under pain of death, were not to teach any thing, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine any thing that the Law had not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; contrary to that which the Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115786:96"/> had firſt agreed. Whereby it is manifeſt, that all theſe Laws and Ordinances afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named, and all others of like nature, which, all common ſenſe muſt allow, to have been more then the Scripture any where mentions, are the productions, of this Right and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, placed by God in the Conſiſtory, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to avoid Schiſm, and keep the body of the people in Unity, by ſhewing them what to ſtand to, when the Law had not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. So that this is nothing contrary to the Law of <hi>Deut.</hi> IV. 2. XII. 32. which forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>to adde to, or take from Gods Law:</hi> the Law remaining intire, when it is ſupplied, by the Power which it ſelf appointeth. And, he that will ſee the truth of this with his eys, let him look upon the Jews Conſtitutions, compiled into the Body of their Talmud. Which, though they are now written, and in our Saviours time were taught from hand to hand: though, by ſucceſſion of time, and change, in the State of that People, they cannot continue in all points the ſame, as they were in our Saviours time; yet, it is manifeſt, that the ſubſtance of them was then in force, becauſe, whatſoever the Goſpel mentions of them, is found to agree, with that which they have now in writing: And are all, manifeſtly, the effect of the lawfull power of the Conſiſtory. Nor let any man
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:115786:96"/> object, that they are the Doctrines of the Phariſees, which, they pretended, that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> received from God in Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and delivered by word of mouth to his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; and that the Sadduces were of another opinion, who never acknowledged any ſuch unwritten Law, but tied themſelves to the letter, (as doth, at this day, one part of the Jews, which renounce the Talmud, and reſt in the letter of the Law, who are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>Karaim,</hi> that is, Scripturaries.) For though all this be true, yet, neither Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees nor Sadduces then, neither Talmudiſts nor Scripturaries now, did, or do make que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, of acknowledging ſuch Laws and Conſtitutions, as are neceſſary to determine, that which grows queſtionable in the practice of the Law; but are both in the wrong, when as, to gain credit to thoſe Orders and Conſtitutions, which both bodies reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge, the one will have them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by God to <hi>Moſes,</hi> the other will needs draw them, by conſequence, out of the letter of the Scripture: And ſo entitle them to God, otherwiſe then he appointed, which is, only, as the reſults, and productions of that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which he ordained to end all matter of difference, by limiting that, which the Law had not. The ſame reaſon, neceſſarily takes place, under the New Teſtament, ſaving the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115786:97"/> difference between the Law and the Goſpel. For, under the Law, this power took place, in the practice of all Ceremoniall and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Laws, proper to the Synagogue: As well, as in determining the circumſtances and ceremonies of the worſhip of God, which ſtill remains under the Goſpel, ſaving the difference thereof from the Law. For, under the Goſpel, there belong to Chriſtianity, two ſorts of things; The firſt whereof, are of the ſubſtance of Chriſtianity, as, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, immediately, the ſalvation of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Chriſtians. And, this kinde is further to be diſtinguiſhed, into matter of Faith, and matter of life, or manners. The ſecond, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns indeed the ſalvation of particular Chriſtians, (as containing, the Unity of the Church, and the due exerciſe of all thoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, which God will be ſerved with, in the Unity of the Church) but mediately, as they are means, to beget, and preſerve, in all Chriſtians, thoſe things of the former ſort, that concern Faith or good maners. For, if it were morally poſſible to imagine, that a man, blameleſly deprived of all means of Communion with the Church, could be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe endowed, with all parts of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, in Faith and good manners, I doe not ſee, how any diſcreet Chriſtian, could deny ſuch a one, the end of Chriſtianity, which is,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:115786:97"/> life everlaſting. All things therefore, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Faith and good Works, neceſſary to the ſalvation of particular Chriſtians, are ſo revealed, or rather ſo commanded, by our Lord and his Apoſtles, that it is not poſſible for all the Church that ſucceeds, to declare any thing to be ſuch, that is not, expreſly, or by conſequence, contained in their writings. For how ſhall all the Church be able, to adde any thing to this number, but by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame motives, which our Lord and his Apoſtles advanced to the World, to perſwade them, not onely, that what they ſpoke, was revealed by God, but alſo, that they were ſent, to require the World, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and obey them? But, as to that which concerns the Society of the Church, and the publick ſervice of God, in the Unity of the ſame, what can we ſay our Lord in Perſon commanded, but the Power of the Keys, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which it is founded, and the Sacraments of Baptiſm and the Euchariſt, in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion whereof, the Unity of the Church conſiſteth? And his Apoſtles, how did they proceed in determining the reſt? Surely, he that will ſay, that they never enacted any thing, till a revelation came on purpoſe from God, will fall under the ſame inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which render, the infallibility of the Pope, or the Church, ridiculous to common
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115786:98"/> ſenſe. Which, if they beleeved themſelves, ſure, they would never call Councels, adviſe with Doctors, debate with one another, to finde what may truly be ſaid, or uſefully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, in matters of difference. In like manner, when the Apoſtles aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> XV. 1—to debate in a full meeting, with <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> the Presbyters of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the reſt, what to reſolve in the matter there queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; I ſay not they were no Prophets, or had no revelations from God, when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: But I ſay, it is manifeſt, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not upon confidence of any revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, promiſed them, at this time and in this place, but upon the habituall underſtanding, which, as well by particular revelation from God, as by the Doctrine of our Lord, they had, proportionable to the Chief Power, over the whole Church, which they were truſted with. To ſpeak ingenuouſly mine own opinion, which I ſeek not to impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any mans Faith, I do beleeve, that ſome perſon, of thoſe that were then aſſembled in Councell, had a preſent inſpiration, revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that Gods will was, that the Decree there enacted, ſhould be made. My reaſon is, becauſe I obſerve, by divers paſſages of the Old and New Teſtaments, that God was wont, to ſend revelations to his Prophets,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:115786:98"/> at the publick Aſſemblies of the Church of Synagogue. As, at the ſending of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Acts</hi> XIII. 2. At the Ordination of <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> IV. 14. At the Aſſemblies of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XIV. 24, 25, 30. At <hi>Joſaphats</hi> Faſt, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XVIII. 14. At Saint <hi>Johns</hi> Ordinations; whereof <hi>Clemens,</hi> in the place afore alleged out of <hi>Euſebius</hi> his Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Hiſtories, ſaith, that the Apoſtle was wont to goe abroad, <hi>to Ordain ſuch as were ſignified by the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, of the Presbyters of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus, That the Holy Ghoſt had ſet them over the flock, Acts</hi> XX. 28. and therefore, when it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> XV. 28. <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and to us,</hi> I take it, that ſome ſuch revelation is intimated. But, this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, when we ſee the meſſage ſent, the Church aſſembled, the cauſe debated, without aſſurance, of any ſuch revelation to be made, whereof no Prophet had aſſurance till it came; we ſee, they proceeded not, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preſumption of it, but upon the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their ordinary power, and the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall abilities, given them to diſcharge it. So that, from the premiſes, we have two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſerving to vindicate the ſame Power to the Church. The firſt, becauſe the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions in force under the Apoſtles, cannot be ſaid to come, from particular extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:115786:99"/> inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, but from the ordinary power, of governing the Church, which was to continue. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, becauſe, by the proceedings of the Councell of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it appears, that no revelation was a ground, or requiſite, to the determining of the matter there in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. To which I adde a third, from S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XI. 16. <hi>If any man be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, we have no ſuch cuſtome, neither the Churches of God.</hi> Where, having diſputed, by many reaſons, that women were to vail their faces, at the Service of God, in the Church, he ſets up his reſt, upon laudable cuſtome of the Church. Now, if cuſtome be available, to create Right in the Church, as in civile Societies, then authority much more, without which, either preſcribing, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, neither that cuſtome which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpecifies, nor any other, could take place. And a fourth, from that obſervation, ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and improved, that no man can deny it, but he that will make himſelf ridiculous, to all men of learning, beſides the inſtances thereof in the premiſes, which is this: That, the Orders which the Apoſtles ſetled in the Church, ſaving the difference between the Law and the Goſpel, are always, or at leaſt moſt an end, drawn from the pattern of the Synagogue. Whereby it appeareth, that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:115786:99"/> the convenience of them was evident, not by revelation, but by humane diſcourſe; but the force of them comes from the authority of the Apoſtles, preſcribing or allowing them in the Church: Both which are always in the Church, though in leſſe meaſure. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this is proved by the premiſes: Wherein I conceive it is proved, that the Clergy, in the Church, ſucceeds into the Authority, of the Jews Conſiſtories, in the Synagogue: Wherefore, having ſhewed, that thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtories did give Law to the Synagogue, in all matters of Religion, not determined by God, it follows, that the ſame may be done in the Church. Sixthly, the ſame followeth, from the dependence of Churches. For, if Congregations be made independent, that no Chriſtian may receive Law from man, wherein he is not ſatisfied of the will of God, then, having proved, that Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not independent, it follows, that they are to receive Law, in all things, not contrary to the will of God. Seventhly, the exerciſe of this Power, in all ages of the Church, and the effects of it, in great vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, of lawfull Canonicall decrees, though it be a mark of contradiction, to them that are reſolved, to hate that which hath been, becauſe it hath been, yet, to all, whoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are not maleficiated with prejudice, it is
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115786:100"/> the ſame evidence of this Power, (though not always of the right uſe of it) by which, Chriſtianity it ſelf ſtands recommended to us. Laſtly, can thoſe of the Congregations ſay, that no publick act is done among them, without the free and willing conſent of all, as ſatisfied in conſcience, that it is the will of God, which is decreed? Then are they not men. For, among all men, there is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of judgement. If notwithſtanding, they are inforced to proceed, why depart they from the Church? For, if thoſe that place the Chiefe Power in Congregations, cannot avoid, to be tied, by other mens acts, why refuſe they to be tied once for all, by ſuch generall acts as Laws are? Which, as they muſt needs be done, by perſons capable to judge, what the common good of the Church requires, (which, it is madneſſe to imagine, that members of Congregations can be) ſo, they have the force, when they are once admitted, to contain the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Church, agreeing to them, in U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: Whereas, to acknowledge no ſuch, tends to create as many Religions as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>And now, to the objection of wil-worſhip, in the obſervation of humane conſtitutions, the anſwer will not be difficult. That ſinne, I doe truly beleeve, to be of a very large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:115786:100"/> as one of the extremes, oppoſite to the Virtue of Religion, underſtanding Religion to be, all ſervice of God with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Thus, all the Idolatries of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, all the ſuperſtitions of Judaiſm, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetiſm, are will-worſhips. For, man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced of his duty to ſerve God, and neither knowing how to perform, nor wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to render that ſervice which he requires, becauſe inconſiſtent with his own inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it follows, that, by a voluntary commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he tender God ſomething, which he is willing to part with, in ſtead of his concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcences. Having condemnation, both for neglecting to tender that which is due, and for diſhonouring God, by thinking him to be bribed, by his inventions, to wink at his ſins. And therefore, I do grant, that the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, which the Synagogue was by Gods Law enabled to make, were capable to be made, the matter of Superſtition and will-worſhip, as indeed, in our Lords time, they were made. The reaſon, becauſe, preſuming to be juſtified by the works of the Law, and the Law, among them, being not onely the written, but that which was taught by word of mouth, the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſees, (which, the Diſciples of Chriſt, ſhall never enter into the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, unleſſe they exceed) conſiſted, not only
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:115786:101"/> in the letter of the Ceremoniall and Judiciall precepts, but, in obſerving the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Conſiſtories. And accordingly, I doe grant, that the Rules, Decrees, and Conſtitutions of the Church, are capable to be made the matter of the ſame ſin; and, that they are made ſo, viſibly, in divers cuſtoms, and practiſes of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But is it a good reaſon to ſay, that, becauſe humane Conſtitutions may be made the ſubject of ſuperſtition, and will-worſhip, therefore the Church hath no Power to make any, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the members of the Church are not ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to obey any? Or, may there not be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and will-worſhip, in abhorring, as well as in obſerving, humane Conſtitutions? If S. <hi>Paul</hi> be in the right, there may. For, if the Kingdome of God, conſiſt in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, not in eating or not eating, in obſerving or not obſerving days, by the ſame reaſon, it conſiſts no more, in not doing, then in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that which the Law of God determineth not. Wherefore, if any man imagine, that he ſhall pleaſe God in not obſerving, in refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, in oppoſing, in deſtroying humane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, regulating the publick order of the Church, it is manifeſt, that this is, becauſe he thinks he ſhall be the better Chriſtian, by forbearing that, which God commands him
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:115786:101"/> not to forbear, ſeeing he can finde in his heart to violate Unity and Charity, that he may forbear it.</p>
               <p>Here, it may be demanded of me, why I expreſſe no other ground, of this Power, in the Church, then the indetermination of thoſe things, which Order, and Unity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to be determined, in the Church: For, ſeeing matters of Faith are determined by Gods Word, it ſeems to follow, that the Church hath nothing to do, to determine of matters of Doctrine, in difference. And, ſeeing the Ceremonies of Divine Service, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the determining of that which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture determineth not, pretend further, to advance, and improve devotion, in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip of God; as I have diſcourſed more at large, in the Apoſtolicall form of Divine Service, <hi>ca.</hi> IX. It ſeems, if there be no other ground, for the Legiſlative Power of the Church, that the Church hath nothing to do, to inſtitute ſuch Ceremonies. To which I anſwer, that it is one thing to make that matter of Faith, which was not, another to determine matter of Faith, that is, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what members of the Church ſhall do, in acknowledging, or not acknowledging, that which is in queſtion, to be, or not to be matter of Faith. For, if there be a Society of the Church, then muſt there be in the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:115786:102"/> Church a Power to determine, what the members thereof ſhall acknowledge, and profeſſe, when it comes in difference: Which is, not to qualifie the ſubject, that is, to make any thing matter of Faith or not, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, that thoſe, which will not ſtand to the Act of the Whole, that is, of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that have right to conclude the Whole, ſhall not be of it. So, the obligation, that ſuch Acts produce, as it comes from the Word of God, which the Church acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, is a duty of Faith, but, as it relates, to the determination of the Church, as a duty of charity, obliging, to concurre with the Church, where it determineth not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, of that which the Word of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth. Again, when I ſay, the Church hath Power, to determine that which Gods Law determines not, I muſt needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to mean, that, which ſhall ſeem to make moſt for the advancement of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Now, the Scripture ſhews, by ſtore of examples, of Ceremonies, in the Publick Service of God, under the Church, as well as under the Synagogue, that the inſtitution of ſignificative Ceremonies, in the Publick worſhip of God, doth make for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of godlineſſe, otherwiſe, ſuch had not been Ordained by the Apoſtles, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of Gods ancient People. For, of this
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:115786:102"/> nature, is the vailing of women, at Divine Service, of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> writes to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians;</hi> the Kiſſe of Charity, ſo often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the writings of the Apoſtles, which the Conſtitutions of the Apoſtles, II. 57. and <hi>Origen</hi> upon the laſt to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> ſhew, to have been practiſed, before the Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the receiving of the Euchariſt, to ſignifie the Charity in which they came to communicate; the many Ceremonies of Baptiſm, to which S. <hi>Paul</hi> alludes, in divers places, <hi>Col.</hi> II. 11, 12. III. 9, 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> VI. 4, 5. to wit, putting off old clothes, drenching in water, ſo as to ſeem to be buried in it, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on new clothes at their comming out: Which, being uſed in the Primitive Church, by theſe paſſages of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> we are ſure, were Inſtituted by the Apoſtles. Of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are the geſtures of Prayer, which we reade in the Scripture, that it was always the cuſtome of Gods people, to make ſitting, kneeling, or groveling, as the inward dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the minde, required, a greater or leſſe degree, of outward humiliation of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to produce, and maintain, as well as to ſignifie it. Thus, our Lord ſtands up to reade the Law, but ſits down to Preach, <hi>Luc.</hi> IV. 16, 20. the one, to ſhew reverence to the Giver of the Law, the other, authority over the Congregation, which he taught as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet:
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:115786:103"/> And therefore, I make no doubt, but that, in receiving the Book of the Law, he uſed that reverence, which was, and is uſed in the Synagogue; the like whereof by the Acts of the Primitive Martyrs, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand to have been uſed, to the Book of the Goſpels; for, in the examination of one of them, you have, <hi>Qui ſunt libri quos adoratis legentes?</hi> as we now, ſtand up at the reading of the Goſpel. Of this nature, are the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Jews publick Faſts, quoted afore out of the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> which, it ſeems, the Prophet <hi>Jonas</hi> taught the Ninevites, at their Faſt, <hi>Jon.</hi> III. 5, 6. which, ſure, have no force, to move God to compaſſion, but, as they move men to that humiliation which procures it; of this nature, is Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of hands, uſed in the Scripture, in Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that is, in ſolemne Prayers, for other Perſons, as in the Goſpel over children, and ſick perſons, as in the Law <hi>Jacob</hi> lays hands on <hi>Joſephs</hi> children, <hi>Moſes</hi> on <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and the LXX Presbyters, the Prophets, on ſuch as they cured, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> VI. 11. whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it was received, by the Ordinance of the Apoſtles, in Confirmation, Penance, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations; as alſo, it is ſaid to be ſtill uſed in ſome Eaſtern Churches, at the Bleſſing of Mariages. In fine, the Frontlets, and the Scrols, which God appoints the Jews to ſet
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:115786:103"/> upon their Fore-heads, and the Poſts of their doores, <hi>Exod.</hi> XIII. 9. <hi>Deut.</hi> VI. 8. XI. 17. for my part, I make a great queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he obligeth them thereby, to uſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the letter, as they do: But, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the effect, the remembrance of the Law, he ſhould be thought to forbid the means, that is, the ſenſible wearing of ſuch marks, that I count utterly incredible: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was eaſie for them, to uſe ſuch marks, and yet, to think themſelves never a whit the holier for them, without the thing ſignified, though in our Lords time, they did ſo, as we ſee by his reproofs in the Goſpel, and though by their writings, <hi>(Maimoni</hi> by name, in the Title of Finages, <hi>cap.</hi> III. and in the Title of Phylacteries, <hi>ca.</hi> XI. <hi>&amp;</hi> XII.) we ſee, that ſtill they do. And thus, upon the reaſons advanced, that is, of determining that, which the Law of God determines not, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the whole Power of the Church, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding matters of Doctrine, in determining the circumſtances and ceremonies of Gods publick worſhip, and of all the Ordinances of God, for the maintenance and exerciſe of the ſame. For, in inſtituting Ceremonies, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficative, not of Chriſt to come, (that indeed, and that onely is Judaiſm) but, of the Faith and devotion which we deſire to ſerve God with, it is enough, that this power may be
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:115786:104"/> exerciſed, to the advancement of godlineſſe; if it be exerciſed otherwiſe then it ought, it is ſtill to be obeyed, becauſe the Unity of the Church is of great conſequence to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, though we attain not that advancement of godlineſſe, which the uſe of this Power ought to procure, but does not: And, if any Power ſhould be void, becauſe it is not uſed for the beſt, or, abſolutely, not well uſed, then could no humane ſociety ſubſiſt, either Sacred or Civile: Which muſt ſubſiſt, in all things, wherein it commands not the contrary, of a more ancient Law, which is Gods Law in our caſe.</p>
               <p>From the premiſes, it will not be difficult to reſolve, whether Councels be of Divine Right, or not, diſtinguiſhing between ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and circumſtance, between the purpoſe and effect of them, and the manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing it. For, if we ſpeak of giving Law to the Society of the Church, it is proved, that, (whether you take it for a Power, or a Duty, a Right, or a Charge, or rather both, ſeeing the one cannot be parted from the other) the Church may, and ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, to determine, what is not determined, but determinable, by conſent of particular Churches, that is, by the conſent of ſuch perſons, which have Power to conclude the conſent, of their reſpective Churches:
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:115786:104"/> Whereof, we have ſhewed, that none can ever be concluded, without the conſent of their reſpective Biſhops. But, if we ſpeak of the circumſtance, and manner of aſſembling, in one place, certain perſons, in behalf of their ſeverall Churches, with authority, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and foreſway, and preingage the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the ſame: We have a precedent, or rather precedents, without a precept, in the Acts of the Apoſtles, where the Apoſtles are aſſembled to Ordain a twelfth Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> I. 13.—where they are aſſembled to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the Order of Deacons, <hi>Acts</hi> VI. 2—where <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> come from <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia</hi> and the Churches depending thereupon, to the Apoſtles and Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to take reſolution in their differences, <hi>Acts</hi> XV. 1—where <hi>Paul</hi> goes in to <hi>James,</hi> to adviſe, how to behave himſelf without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, to the Chriſtian Jews at <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> XXI. 18—(for, the premiſes being admitted, all theſe meetings are juſtly and neceſſarily counted Synods, or Councels, both in regard of the Perſons whereof they conſiſted, the conſent of divers Apoſtles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of as much authority to the Church, as the reſolution of a Synod, and in regard of the matter determined at them, concerning the whole Church, in a high degree, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at that time.) And we have a Canon
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:115786:105"/> among thoſe of the Apoſtles, (which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears very ancient, by the Canons of Nice, containing the ſame, and turning Cuſtome into Statute Law) commanding, that Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods be held in every Province twice a year. But, when <hi>Tertullian</hi> tels us, that, in the parts of <hi>Greece,</hi> they held Councels ordinarily, he conſtrains us to beleeve, that in other parts of the Church they did not; and, when we reade of perſecutions, againſt the ordinary aſſemblies of the Church, we muſt preſume, that, as the perſecution of Councells, would have made greater deſolation in the Church, ſo muſt they needs be more ſubject to be perſecuted. And, by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and the reſt of the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories, and by the communication of the Primitive Biſhops, <hi>Clemens, Ignatius, Polycarpus,</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and the reſt, as they follow, ſtill extant in their Epiſtles, we underſtand, that their perſonall Aſſemblies were ſupplied by their <hi>Formatae,</hi> or letters of mark, whereby, the acts of ſome Churches, the moſt eminent, being appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the reſt, after they were ſent to them, purchaſed the ſame force with the Acts of Councels. Wherefore, the holding of Councels, is of Divine right, ſo farre as it is manifeſt to common ſenſe, that it is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier way to diſpatch matters determinable, though, when it cannot be had, not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115786:105"/> neceſſary. But it is always neceſſary, that, ſeeing no Church can be concluded, without the Biſhop thereof, the Biſhops of all Churches, concurre to the Acts that muſt oblige their Churches. Not ſo their Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, becauſe it is manifeſt, that all Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cannot concurre, though upon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar occaſion, ſome may, as the Presbyters of the Church where a Councell is held, as at <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> XV. 6. which we finde, therefore, practiſed, in divers Councels of the Church. As, to ſupply the place of their Biſhops, by deputation in their abſence, or, perhaps, as to propound matters of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary conſequence. As for the whole Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to be concluded by the Act of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, as all cannot always be preſent, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the dependence of Churches, ſo nothing hinders any part thereof to intercede in any thing, contrary to Chriſtianity, that is, of the ſubſtance thereof, or of Divine right. Therefore, in the Order of holding Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, which is wont to be put before the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of the Councels, the people is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be preſent, as they were at <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> XV. 12, 13, 22.</p>
               <p>I come now to a nice Point, of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall Right of the Church, to Tithes, Firſt-fruits, and Oblations: For, as it cannot be pretended, that the ſame meaſure which the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115786:106"/> Law provideth, is due under the Goſpel, ſo it is manifeſt, that the quality of Prieſts and Levites, to whom they were due, is ceaſed as much, as the Sacrifices which they were to attend; and it is certain, that they were maintained, expreſly, in conſideration of that attendance. This difficulty muſt be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by the difference between the Law and the Goſpel. The Law expreſly provideth onely, for the Ceremoniall Service of God, in the Temple, by Sacrifices, and Figures of good things to come. But, no man doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that there were always aſſemblies for the Service of God, all over the Country, for the opportunity whereof, in time, Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues were built, where the Law was taught, and publick Prayers offered to God. This Office of Teaching the Law, cannot be reſtrained to the Tribe of <hi>Levi.</hi> So farre as the Prophets, and their Schools of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, furniſhed it not, their Conſiſtories, which had the Authority to determine, what was lawfull, what unlawfull, were conſequently charged with this Office. Now, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted not onely of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> but in the firſt place, of the beſt of their Cities, to whom were added, as aſſiſtant, ſome of that Tribe, (unleſſe we ſpeak of the Prieſts Cities in particular, for, credibly, the Conſiſtories of them, conſiſted only of Prieſts.) For, that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:115786:106"/> Tribe, being diſperſed all over the Land, to gather their revenue, were, by that means, ready to attend on this Office, of aſſiſting in Judgement, and Teaching the Law. So ſaith <hi>Joſephus, Antiq.</hi> IV. 8. that the Conſiſtories of particular Cities, conſiſted of ſeven, Chief of every City, aſſiſted, each with two, of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> which, with a Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and his Deputy or Second, (ſuch as we know the High Conſiſtory at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had) makes up the number of XXIII, which the Talmud Doctors ſay they conſiſted of. Therefore, it is a miſtake, of them that think, the Scribes and Phariſees, whom our Lord commands to obey, had uſurped the Office of the Prieſts and Levites. For, what hinders the Prieſts and Levites, to be Scribes and Phariſees themſelves, though other Iſraelites were Scribes and Phariſees, beſides Prieſts and Levites? Neither Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, nor Prieſts and Levites, had this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as Phariſees, or as Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, but as members or aſſiſtants of the Conſiſtories. The reaſon, becauſe Gods Law, whereby his worſhip was determined, was alſo the Civile Law of that People, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was promiſed them, upon condition, of living according to it; therefore, the Teaching of the Law muſt belong to them, who, by the Law, were
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:115786:107"/> to Judge, and Govern the People: God ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up Prophets from time to time, to clear the true meaning thereof from humane cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. So onely, the Service of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and only that Tribe, which attended on the Service of the Temple, was to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, the reſt being provided for, by the poſſeſſion of the Land of Promiſe. But, when the ſervice of God in Spirit and Truth, was to be eſtabliſhed in all places, as well as at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Church incorporated by God, into one Society and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, for the exerciſe thereof, what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment God appointed this Corporation for the Exchequer of it, is beſt judged, by what appears to have been done in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, which cannot be attributed, but to the authority of the Apoſtles, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church at that time. At <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> the Contributions were ſo great in the beginning of Chriſtianity, that many offered their whole eſtates, to maintain the community of the Church. Was this to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige all Chriſtians ever after, to deſtroy ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile ſociety by communion of goods? As if there could be no other reaſon, why Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould ſtrip themſelves of their eſtates at that time. The advancement of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, then in the ſhell, required continuall attendance of the whole Church, upon the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:115786:107"/> Service of God. This, withdrawing the greater part of Diſciples, which were poor, from the means of living, required greater oblations of the rich. The Scripture teaches us, that the whole Church continued in the Service of God: So that, out of the common ſtock of the Church, common entertainment was provided for rich and poor, at which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, the Sacrament of the Euchariſt was celebrated, as it was inſtituted by our Lord, at his laſt Supper. This is that which is called <hi>Breaking of Bread, Acts</hi> II. 42, 46. XX. 7. and, by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XI. 20. <hi>the Supper of the Lord,</hi> not meaning thereby, the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, but, this common entertainment, at which that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was celebrated, which therefore is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the <hi>Sacrament of the Lords Supper,</hi> not <hi>the Supper of the Lord;</hi> for, you ſee, the Apoſtle complains, that, becauſe the rich and the poor ſupped not together, therefore they did not celebrate the Supper of the Lord. The ſame thing it is, which S. <hi>Jude, ver.</hi> 12. calls their <hi>Feaſts of Love.</hi> And, the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon this entertainment, was the cauſe of making the Deacons, which is called therefore <hi>the daily miniſtration,</hi> and <hi>atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance at Tables, Acts</hi> VI. 1, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Now, will any man ſay, that thoſe Primitive Chriſtians, held not themſelves tied to pay Tithes, that
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:115786:108"/> offered all their eſtates? At <hi>Corinth,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve S. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> that this courſe was not frequented every day, as at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but, probably, the firſt day of the week, becauſe upon that, the Diſciples aſſembled at <hi>Troas, Acts</hi> XX. 7. or, perhaps, upon other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alſo; for, to have done always every where as at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> would have deſtroied civile Society, which the Goſpel pretendeth to preſerve. But, thoſe that offer the Firſt-fruits of their goods to this purpoſe, when Secular Laws enable them not, to endow the Church with their Tithes, doe they not acknowledge that duty, and that, as taught by the Apoſtles, ſo to acknowledge it? For, can any living man imagine, that they were weary of their eſtates, if the Apoſtles, from whom they received their Chriſtianity, had not informed them, that Chriſtianity requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it at their hands? In the next place, let us conſider the contributions, which the Churches of the Gentiles, were wont to ſend to the Chriſtians at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> being brought low, by parting with their eſtates. It is to be underſtood, that the Jews, that lived out of their own Country, diſperſed in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and Parthian Empires, not being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law of Tithes, which was given to the Land of Promiſe, nor reſorting to the Temple, were, notwithſtanding, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:115786:108"/> of the ſame, wont to make a ſtock, out of which they ſent their Oblations, from time to time, to maintain the Service of God, as is to be ſeen up and down in <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> beſides <hi>Philo</hi> and the Talmud Doctors. If then, the Churches of the Gentiles, in imitation hereof, contribute their Oblations, to ſupport the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Service of God there, (being then the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther City of Chriſtianity, before it was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Capitall Cities of the Romane Empire) as by all thoſe paſſages appears, which mention the Oblations of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſent to <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> XI. 30. XII. 25. <hi>Rom.</hi> XV. 26. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> VIII. IX. <hi>per tot.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XVI. 1. <hi>Gal.</hi> II. 10. do they not therby openly profeſſe themſelves, taught by the Apoſtles, that they were under the ſame obligation, of maintaining the ſervice of God, in the Church, as the Jews, in the Temple? Again, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, having ſhewed, that Chriſtians have the ſame right of communicating in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Chriſt crucified, as the Jews, in the Sacrifices that were not wholly conſumed by fire, in the paſſage handled afore, of <hi>Heb.</hi> XIII. 8-14. purſues it thus in the next words: <hi>By him then let us offer continually to God the Sacrifice of Praiſe, which is the fruit of the lips, giving thanks to his Name: But to doe good and communicate forget not, for</hi>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:115786:109"/> 
                  <hi>with ſuch ſacrifices God is well pleaſed.</hi> Where, by the Sacrifice of Praiſe, he means the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, as it is called uſually, in the ancient Liturgies, and writings of the Fathers: For, to this purpoſe, is the whole diſpute of that place, that, in that Sacrament, Chriſtians communicate in the Sacrifice of Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, (which Jews can have no right to) in ſtead of all the Sacrifices of the Law. And therefore, by doing good and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he means the Oblations of the faithfull, out of which, at the beginning, the poor and the rich lived in common at the Aſſemblies of the Church; and, when that courſe could no more ſtand with the ſucceeding ſtate of the Church, both the Euchariſt was celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the perſons that attended on the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, were maintained. Therefore this obligation ceaſeth not, though the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall Law be taken away. The next ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is from the words of S. <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> IV. 11—in which, few or none take notice of any thing to this purpoſe, but to me, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them with the premiſes, it ſeemeth ſo expreſſe, that it were a wrong to the Church, ſo much concerned in them, to let them goe any longer without notice. <hi>He hath made</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul) ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Evangeliſts, ſome Paſtors, and Doctors. For the compacting of the Saints, for the work</hi>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:115786:109"/> 
                  <hi>of miniſtery, for the edification of the Body of Chriſt.</hi> That is, as it follows, <hi>that being ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in love, we may grow in all things, in him who is the Head, even Chriſt. From whom the whole Body, compacted and put together, by the furniſhing of every limb, according to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king proportionable in every part, cauſeth the body to waxe, unto the edification of it ſelf in love.</hi> Here you are to mark theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the New Teſtament, ſignifies, in a vulgar ſenſe, to furniſh any man maintenance, as <hi>Mat.</hi> XXV. 44. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> II. 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> VI. 10. <hi>Luc.</hi> VIII. 2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> IV. 10. In another ſenſe it is uſed to ſignifie the Service of God, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the Goſpel: but, almoſt always, with ſome addition, diſcovering the metaphor, by expreſſing the ſubject of that ſervice, to wit, <hi>the Word, the Goſpell, the Spirit, the New Covenant, Acts</hi> VI. 6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> V. 18, 19. III. 8. In this ſenſe it is commonly taken here, but it ſeems a miſtake. For, when the Apoſtle ſaith, that God hath given his Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and Teachers, <hi>for the Compacting of the Saints, for the work of miniſtery, for the edification of the Body of Chriſt,</hi> his meaning is, that the Body of the Church, is compacted and held together, to frequent publick Aſſemblies, by the Contribution of the rich, to the maintenance of thoſe that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:115786:110"/> upon the ſervice of God, (which is here called, the work of miniſtery) to the end, that, by the Doctrine of the Governors and Teachers of the Church, at the ſaid Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, it may be built up to a full meaſure of Chriſtianity. This ſenſe, the words that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low require: <hi>From whom the whole Body com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted—</hi>that is, that the Body of the Church, being inabled frequently to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by the operation of thoſe that are able, furniſhing every member, proportionably to his want, commeth, by Chriſt, to perfection in Chriſtianity. This ſenſe, the parallel pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Rom.</hi> XII. 4, 7, 8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> IV. 4. neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily argue: Where, having ſpeech of thoſe things, which, particular members of the Church, are to contribute to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole, both Apoſtles expreſſe two kinds of them, one ſpirituall, of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in Chriſtianity, the other corporall, of means to ſupport the Church, in holding their Aſſemblies. For, as thoſe that want, cannot balk the neceſſities of this life, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon Divine Service, unleſſe they be furniſhed by the body of the Church: So, much more, thoſe that miniſter the Service of the Church, cannot attend upon the ſame, unleſſe they be ſecured of their ſupport. And for this cauſe, the firſt Chriſtians at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and by their example, they that ſent
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115786:110"/> their Oblations to the Church, laid them down at the Apoſtles feet, to ſignifie, that they ſubmitted them to their diſpoſing: For this cauſe Deacons were created, to execute their diſpoſition of the ſame: For this cauſe, the contributions of the Church of <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia,</hi> are conſigned to the Presbyters of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, Acts</hi> XI. 30. that they, who were Ordained by that time, (for, afore there is no mention of them) might diſpoſe of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Apoſtles: For this cauſe <hi>Timothy</hi> is directed, how to beſtow this ſtock among the Widows and Presbyters, that the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows might attend upon prayer day and night, and upon other good works, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the community of the Church, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> V. 5, 10. as <hi>Anna</hi> the Widow in the Goſpel, <hi>Luc.</hi> II. 36, 37. and as the good women that kept guard about the Tabernacle, <hi>Ex.</hi> XXXVIII. 8. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> II. 22. And for this cauſe, S. <hi>Peter</hi> forbiddeth the Presbyters to domineer over the Clergy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> V. 3. to wit, in diſpoſing of their maintenance, out of this common ſtock of the Church. Here, it will be ſaid, that all this expreſſes no quantity, ot part of every mans eſtate, to ground a right of Tithes, and, that no man deſires better, then to give what he liſt. And, the anſwer is as ready, that no man deſires more, provided he liſt to give what Chriſtianity requires:
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115786:111"/> And, that for the determination of what Chriſtianity requires, he liſt to ſtand to the perpetuall practice of the Church, when as, by thoſe things which we finde recorded in the Scriptures, it appears to be derived from the Apoſtles themſelves. Firſt, it is not the Law that firſt commanded to pay Tithes: Becauſe we know, they were paid by <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> (they that think they were not due by Right, before the Law, becauſe <hi>Jacob</hi> vows them, <hi>Gen.</hi> XXVIII. 20. doe not remember our Vow of Baptiſm, the ſubject whereof is things due before) &amp; God requires them as his own before. For God ſaith, firſt, <hi>that Tithes are his own, Lev.</hi> XXVII. 30. to wit, by a Law in force afore the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and then gives them to the Prieſts, for their Service in the Tabernacle. Then, it cannot ſtand with Chriſtianity, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth greater grace of God then the Law, to allow a ſcarcer proportion, to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Gods Service, then the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. Now, the Law requires, firſt, two ſorts of Firſt fruits, the one to be taken by the Prieſt at the Barn, <hi>Num.</hi> XVIII. 12. the other to be brought to the Sanctuary, <hi>Exod.</hi> XXII. 29. XXIII. 19. <hi>Deut.</hi> XXVI. 1—the quantity of either being, in the moderate Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, a fiftieth, as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> upon <hi>Ezek.</hi> XLV. agreeing with the Jews Conſtitutions
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:115786:111"/> in <hi>Maimoni,</hi> of Firſt-fruits, <hi>cap.</hi> II. and of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, <hi>cap.</hi> III. determineth it, though the Scripture, <hi>Ezek.</hi> XLV. 13. require but the ſixtieth: After that, a Tith of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Levites; then, another Tith of the remainder, to be ſpent in ſacrificing at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi> that is, for the moſt part, upon the Prieſts and Levites, to whom, and to the poor, it wholly belonged every third year, <hi>Deut.</hi> XIV. 22, 28. <hi>Ex.</hi> XXIII. 19. XXXIV. 20. Adde hereunto the firſt-born, all ſinne-offerings, and the Prieſts part of peace-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, the skins of Sacrifices, (which alone <hi>Philo</hi> makes a chief part of their revenue) all conſecrations, and the Levites Cities, and it will eaſily appear, it could not be ſo little as a fift part of the fruit of the land, that came to their ſhare. Now, that any rate ſhould be determined by the Goſpel, agrees not with the difference between it and the Law. This, conſtraining obedience by fear, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, under penalty of vengeance from heaven, to pay ſomuch: That, perſwading men, firſt, freely to give themſelves to God, cannot doubt, that they which doe ſo, will freely part with their goods for his ſervice. And therefore, if the perpetuall practice of Chriſtians, muſt limit the ſenſe of thoſe Laws, which the Scripture limits not, we ſee the firſt Chriſtians at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> farre outdoe
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115786:112"/> any thing that ever was done under the Law, and we ſee that all Chriſtian people, in all ſucceeding ages, have done, what the Church now requires but to be continued.</p>
               <p>To this originall Title, accrues another by Conſecration, which is an act of man, infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Law of God. There is, in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> one kinde of Ceremoniall Holineſſe, proper to perſons, conſiſting in a diſtance, from things, not really unclean, but, as ſigns of reall uncleanneſſe. As, from meats and drinks, and, touching creatures, &amp; men, and women, in ſome diſeaſes, of which our Lord hath ſaid, that, <hi>what goeth into the mouth polluteth not,</hi> much leſſe, what a man onely toucheth; and ſo, hath ſhewed, that all this ceaſeth under the Goſpel. But there is another kinde of Holineſſe, belonging to Times, and Places, as well as Perſons, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Law, upon a reaſon common to the Goſpel, when it is ſaid, <hi>Lev.</hi> XIX. 30. <hi>Obſerve my Sabbaths, and reverence my San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries.</hi> For, did this belong onely to the Temple, or Tabernacle, inſtituted by Gods expreſſe command, for that ceremoniall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, which was unlawfull any where elſe, it might ſeem to be proper to the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Law, and to vaniſh with the Goſpel. But, the perpetuall practice of that people ſhews, that, hereby they are commanded to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:115786:112"/> uſe reverence in their Synagogues, which were neither inſtituted by any written pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Law, nor for the ceremoniall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, which was confined to the Temple, but for publick Aſſemblies, to hear the Law read and expounded, and to offer the Prayers of the people to God. For, in the Pſalms of <hi>Aſaph,</hi> which is the only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Synagogues in the Old Teſtament, they are called, not onely <hi>Houſes,</hi> and <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of God,</hi> but alſo <hi>Sanctuaries,</hi> as here, <hi>Pſ.</hi> LXXIII. 17. LXXIV. 4, 7, 8. LXXXIV. 13. And the Talmud Doctors, related by <hi>Maimoni,</hi> extend this Precept to them, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at large, the reverence which they requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; whereupon <hi>Philo</hi> in his Book <hi>De Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione ad Caium,</hi> cals them places of ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Holineſſe, to wit, in reſpect of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And in <hi>Maimoni,</hi> in the Title of Praier and the Prieſts Bleſſing, <hi>cap.</hi> XI. you have at large, of the Holineſſe of Synagogues, and Schools, which they eſteem more Holy then Synagogues. They may have joy of their Doctrine, that endeavour to ſhew, that the Jews Synagogues were not counted Holy Places, becauſe in the Goſpels, as well as in <hi>Euſebius</hi> Hiſtories, IV. 16. (where he alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, out of a certain ancient writing againſt the Montaniſts, that none of them was ever ſcourged by the Jews in their Synagogues)
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115786:113"/> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> againſt the Ebionites, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the Jews uſed to puniſh by ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in their Synagogues: For, it hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſo good effect, as to turn Churches to Stables. But he that underſtands their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon right, will inferre the contradictory of their concluſion from it. For, becauſe Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues were the places, where matters of Gods Law were ſentenced, as I ſhewed afore, therefore was that ſentence to be executed in Synagogues. The like reaſon there is, for the Holineſſe of Perſons, conſecrate to the ſervice of God, in the like precept, <hi>Levit.</hi> XIX. 32. <hi>Stand up before the gray head: and reverence the Presbyters: and fear thy Gods. I am the Lord.</hi> Where, the gradation ſhews, that this Text concerns not the fear of God, but the reverence due to their Judges and Doctors of the Law. It is a vulgar miſtake, that Soveraign Powers are called Gods in the Scriptures. The Jews are in the right, that their Judges, made by Impoſition of Hands, are they, whom the Scripture calls Gods. For ſo it is uſed, to ſignifie thoſe that were to judge Gods people, by Gods Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> XXI. 6. XXII. 8, 9. Neither doth it ſignifie any but the Conſiſtory, <hi>Pſ.</hi> LXXXII. 1, 6. being, it ſeems, at that time, when this Pſalm was penned, for <hi>Abſalom,</hi> or for <hi>Saul,</hi> againſt <hi>David:</hi> For, theſe are they, <hi>to whom</hi>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:115786:113"/> 
                  <hi>the word of the Lord came,</hi> as our Saviour ſays, <hi>Iohn</hi> IX. 35. that is, whom the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law was truſted with. Now, you have ſeen, that Presbyters were a degree un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Judges: and therefore, the gradation can hold onely thus; Firſt, <hi>ſtand up before the gray hairs,</hi> that is, them who are onely ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable for their age: Secondly, <hi>reverence Preſbyters,</hi> which, beſides years, having ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died the Law till thirty or forty years of age, had authority to Teach the Law: And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>fear your Judges,</hi> who have power to ſentence matters of difference. Thus the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation continues in the ſame kinde, and thus this precept is interpreted by the Talmud Doctors, in <hi>Maimoni,</hi> in the Title of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Law, <hi>c.</hi> 6. &amp; <hi>Moſes</hi> of <hi>Kotzi</hi> upon this Precept. Having therefore ſhewed, that the Clergy in the Church, ſucceed into the authority, which the Conſiſtories bore under the Synagogue; it follows, that, the precept of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> V. 12, 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> XIII. 17. imports this reverence due to them, as perſons conſecrate to the ſervice of God. And ſo this holineſſe, is the ſame in Perſons, as in Places, conſecrate to that purpoſe. There is no man ſo ſimple, as to think Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches capable of that holineſſe, by which Chriſtian ſouls are holy: But, becauſe the actions of Gods ſervice, proceeding from
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115786:114"/> ſouls ſo qualified, are preſumed to be Holy, therefore the Times, the Places, the Perſons, deputed to ſuch actions in publick, are to be reverenced in regard of that deputation, for their works ſake, ſaith the Apoſtle, in an Eccleſiaſticall, not in any ſpirituall capacity, common to Perſons with Times and Places: Becauſe this qualification ſerves to maintain, in the minds of people, the reverence they owe to thoſe acts of Gods ſervice, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they are deputed. Which, thoſe that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beleeved heretofore, do now ſee, by that ruine of Chriſtianity, which theſe few years have brought to paſſe amongſt us. This ground, the Jews Doctors ſeem very well to underſtand, when they queſtion, why the open ſtreet, or <hi>Piazza,</hi> is not Holy, ſeeing, the Publick Faſts of the Jews, were many times held in them: Thoſe Aſſemblies being, it ſeems, ſo great, that the Synagogue would not contain the people: (Where, by the way, you ſee, why our Lord reproves the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, becauſe they loved to <hi>pray ſtanding in the corners of ſtreets, and to ſound a trumpet before their alms, Mat.</hi> VI. 2, 5. becauſe thoſe Faſts were ſolemnized in the ſtreet, with ſound of Trumpet;) Their anſwer is, that the market place, or ſtreet, or <hi>Piazza,</hi> is uſed accidentally to this purpoſe, but the Synagogue is deputed expreſly to it. <hi>Maimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:115786:114"/> 
                  <hi>Of Prayer and the Prieſts Bleſsing, cap.</hi> XI. The reaſon then, of this Eccleſiaſticall, or morall holineſſe, is the deputation to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ordinances of Divine Service, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, if it be by Ordinance of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſolemnized upon perſons, by prayer, with Impoſition of Hands, why ſhall it not be ſolemnized by Conſecration of Places, which is nothing elſe, but the ſolemne depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of them to their purpoſe, by prayer to God, as perſons are conſecrated, when they are deputed to the ſervice of God? And, is it not ſtrange, that any man ſhould finde a negative reverence due to the places of Gods ſervice, but, all poſitive reverence, nothing elſe then ſuperſtition revived? For, what reaſon can be given, why men ſhould abſtain from light, or vain, or ſecular buſineſſe, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment, or cariage, in Churches, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the minde is to be poſſeſſed, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed about the contrary? And what reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and devotion to God, in the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Service, can be maintained, without making difference between common and Conſecrate Places, is not to be ſeen by the practice of this time, that hath laid all reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and devotion aſide, and therefore, it ſeems, will never be ſeen again, untill that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence be revived again, and ſenſibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, to Perſons and Places dedicated to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:115786:115"/> Gods ſervice, (for Times deputed to Gods ſervice, are not ſubject to ſenſe, therefore, not capable of the like) by ſuch ſolemnities, as may be fit to maintain that inward devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the Ordinances of Gods ſervice, to which they are deputed, are to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with. And, not only Times, Places, and Perſons, are capable of this morall qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, of relative Eccleſiaſticall Holineſſe, but whatſoever, either by diſpoſition of Gods Law, or by mans act, is affected to the ſervice of God. For, ſo ſaith our Saviour, <hi>That the Temple conſecrates the gold which it is adorned with, and the Altar the gift that is offered upon it;</hi> and that therefore, <hi>He that ſweareth by the Temple, or the Altar, ſweareth by God, to whoſe ſervice they were offered, Mat.</hi> XXIII. 17, 19, 20—And the Jews <hi>Corban,</hi> which our Lord reproveth, as uſed to binde that which was againſt Gods Law, <hi>Mat.</hi> XV. 5. was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an Oath, by the Oblations conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the reparations of the Temple, as you may ſee in <hi>Grotius.</hi> And, as Firſt-fruits and Tithes, which the Law conſecrates to God, render him ſacrilegious and accurſed, that touches them againſt the intent of the Law, as you ſee by that allegory of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Jer.</hi> II. 3. <hi>Iſrael is a thing conſecrate to the Lord, the Firſt-fruit of his revenue: all that devoure him are guilty, evill haunts them:</hi>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:115786:115"/> So the Law, in obliging men to conſecrate what they would to the Lord, makes the conſecrate thing <hi>anathema,</hi> that is, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon accurſed, that applies it to any other uſe, <hi>Levit.</hi> XXVII. 28. Under the Goſpel the difference is onely this, that nothing is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate, by diſpoſition of the Law, without the act of man, moved by the Law of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, to conſecrate it: According to that difference between the Law and the Goſpel, alleged before, that, becauſe the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth to obedience for fear of miſchief, the Goſpel winneth obedience by love of goodneſs, therefore, in correſpondence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, the Law was to require the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Gods ſervice, under ſuch Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as they ſhould not dare to incurre; the Goſpel, by the ſame freedome of minde, which conſtrained men to give themſelves to God, was to conſtrain them, to give their goods to the maintenance of his Service. For the reſt, as under the Law, the Gold is conſecrated by the Temple, and the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice by the Altar; and ſo, all conſecration, tended to communion with God, by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of Sacrifices offered to God: So, having ſhewed, how the Goſpel ordaineth, that Chriſtians alſo communicate with God, in the Sacrifice of the Croſſe, by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Euchariſt, by the ſame reaſon it
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:115786:116"/> follows, that, what is given to build and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, and beautifie Churches, to maintain the Aſſemblies of the Church, to ſupport them that miniſter Gods Ordinances, to inable the poor to attend upon the Communion of the ſame, is conſecrated by the Altar of the Croſſe, and the Sacrifice thereof, repreſented in the Euchariſt, being the chief part of that ſervice, which the Church tenders to God, and that which is peculiar to Chriſtianity. S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> truly, conſtrues, the reaſon why our Lord would not have <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> reproved, for pouring out ſuch an expenſe on his body to no purpoſe, which might have done ſo much good among the poore, <hi>Mat.</hi> XXVI. 11. to be this, that Chriſtians might underſtand themſelves, to be bound, as well to maintain the means of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as the poor that attend upon it. And, let any man ſhew me the difference of the ſin of <hi>Achan,</hi> from that of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> For, as he became accurſed, by touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which was deputed to maintain Gods ſervice, and was ſo, before he denied it: So, no man can imagine, that theſe had been guiltleſſe, if they had confeſſed: For they are charged by the Apoſtle, not only for ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Holy Ghoſt, but for withdrawing part of the price, <hi>Acts</hi> V. 3. And therefore, by the premiſes, having ſhewed, that the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:115786:116"/> goods which were laid down at the Apoſtles feet, were thereby affected, applied, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to maintain the Body of the Church, in the daily Communion of the Service of God, eſpecially of the Euchariſt, which they frequented, <hi>Acts</hi> II. 42, 46. it followeth, that they were conſecrated to God by the Altar, as all Oblations of Chriſtians, to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Gods ſervice, are, by the Sacrifice of the Croſſe, repreſented and commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, being the chief part of the ſervice of God under the Goſpel, and that which is onely proper to Chriſtians. And, by conſequence, that which is conſecrate to the ſervice of God, under the Goſpel, is <hi>anathema,</hi> for the ſame reaſon, as under the Law, becauſe, they are accurſed, that take upon them to apply it to any other uſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe things premiſed, it will not be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, to determine the limits, of Soveraign and Eccleſiaſticall Power, in the conduct and eſtabliſhment of matters of Religion, in a Chriſtian State. Which, ſeeing it chiefly conſiſts, in the Right of giving thoſe Laws, by which this eſtabliſhment and conduct is executed; and having ſhewed, that the Right of Soveraign Power, in Church matters, is not deſtructive, but cumulative to the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Church, and that there is an Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:115786:117"/> Right in the Church, of giving Laws, as to the Society of the Church: It follows, that the Right of making thoſe Laws, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Religion is eſtabliſhed in a Chriſtian State, belonging, both to the Soveraign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and to the Church, are not diſtinguiſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the ſubject, (for I have premiſed, that Soveraign Powers may make Laws of Church matters) but by the ſeverall reaſons, and grounds, and intents of both. That is to ſay, that the determining of the matter of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Laws, in Order to the ſentence of Excommunication, which the Church is able to inforce them with, belongs to the Church, that is, to thoſe, whom we have ſhewed, to have that power, on behalf of the Church: But, the enacting of them, as Laws of Civile Societies, in order to thoſe Privileges and Penalties, which States are able to inforce Religion with, belongs to the Soveraign Powers, that give Law to thoſe States. For, here it is to be known, that any Religion, is made the Religion of any State, by two manner of means, that is, of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Privileges, and temporall Penalties: For, how much toleration ſoever is allowed ſeverall Religions, in any State, none of them can be counted the Religion of the State, till it be ſo privileged, as no other can be privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged in that State. Though it becomes the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:115786:117"/> Religion of that State ſtill more manifeſtly, when Penalties are eſtabliſhed, either upon the not exerciſe of the Religion eſtabliſhed, or upon the exerciſe of any other beſides it. Thoſe of the Congregations ſeem indeed hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto to maintain, that no Penalty can be inflicted, by any State, upon any cauſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to which Point I will anſwer by and by. Which if it were ſo, then could no Religion be the Religion of any State, but by temporall Privileges. In the mean time, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving determined, that, by the Word of God, Chriſtianity is to be maintained by Secular Power, and, ſeeing it cannot be ingraffed into any State, but by making the Laws thereof, the Laws of that State, in this doing, my concluſion is, that the matter of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Laws, is determinable by the Church, the force of them, as to ſuch means, as the State is able to enact them with, muſt come from the State. The reaſon is, firſt, from that of the Apoſtle, pronounced by him in one particular caſe, but, which may be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralized to this purpoſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> VII. 20, 24. <hi>Every one, in what ſtate he is called to be a Chriſtian, therein let him continue.</hi> Which if it hold, neither can any quality, in any Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Society, give any man that Right, which ariſeth from the Conſtitution of the Church, nor on the contrary. Wherefore, ſeeing it
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:115786:118"/> is manifeſt, that there is in the Church, a Power of giving Laws, to every reſpective part of it, as it is granted, that there is in all Soveraign Powers, in reſpect of all perſons and cauſes, it follows, that they are diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhable, by the ſeverall reaſons, on which they ſtand, and ariſe, and the ſeverall intents, to which they operate, and the effects they are able to produce. Secondly, no Religion, but Judaiſm, was ever given immediately by God to any State, and that, by ſuch Laws, as determine both the exerciſe of Religion, and the Civile Government of that people. But, all Nations think they have received Religion, from ſome Divinity which they beleeve, and therefore, by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the ordering of matters of Religion, muſt needs belong to thoſe, by whom, and from whom, ſeverall Nations beleeve they have received it. Much more Chriſtianity, received from and by our Lord and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, muſt needs be referred to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of thoſe, whom, we have ſhewed, they left truſted with it. But the Power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the exerciſe of Religion, is a point of Soveraignty, uſed by all States, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſeverall Laws. Wherefore, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, much more obliging all Soveraigns, to uſe this Power, to the advancement of it, the coactive Power of ſecular Societies, muſt
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:115786:118"/> needs take place much more, in eſtabliſhing Chriſtianity, by ſuch conſtitutions, as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity may be eſtabliſhed with. Thirdly, the whole Church, is by Divine Right, one Viſible Society, though to an inviſible pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and the Power of giving Laws, either to the whole, or to ſeverall parts of it, of Divine Right. But, neither the whole, nor the parts of it, are neceſſarily convertible with any one State, and yet the Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeverall States, many times in extreme need, of the uſe of that power, which God hath given his Church, to determine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters determinable: Therefore, this power cannot be veſted in any of the States, under which the Church is concerned, but in thoſe that have Power, in behalf of the Churches, reſpectively concerned. The fourth argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is very copious, from the exerciſe of this power, in the Religion inſtituted by God, among his ancient people, of which nature there is nothing in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe, in the times whereof it ſpeaks, Soveraign Powers were not Chriſtian. I have ſhewed in divers places of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that the High Conſiſtory of the Jews at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> had power to determine all queſtions, that became determinable, in the matter of Laws given by God. And yet there is great appearance, that this Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:115786:119"/> it ſelf, was not conſtantly ſetled there, according to Law, till <hi>Joſaphats</hi> time, at leaſt, not the inferiour Conſiſtories, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Law of <hi>Deut.</hi> XVI. 18. as the Chief, by the Law of <hi>Deut.</hi> XVII. 8—to be ſetled in the ſeverall Cities. For, if ſo, why ſhould the Judges, and <hi>Samuel,</hi> ride circuit, up and down the Country, to miniſter juſtice according to the Law, as we reade they did then, <hi>Jud.</hi> V. 10. X. 4. XII. 14. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> VII. 16. but not after <hi>Joſaphats</hi> time. And, for this reaſon, it ſeems, <hi>Joſaphat</hi> himſelf, being to put this Law in force, firſt, <hi>ſent Judges up and down the Cities,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XVII. 8, 9. afterwards ſetled them according to the Law, <hi>in the Cities of Juda as well as at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XIX. 5, 8. Beſides, <hi>Joſephus,</hi> in expreſſe terms, rendring a reaſon of the diſorder upon which the warre againſt <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi> followed, attributes it to this, that the Conſiſtories were not eſtabliſhed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Law, <hi>Antiq.</hi> V. 2. And again, <hi>Antiq.</hi> V. 5. he gives this for the cauſe, why <hi>Eglon</hi> undertook to ſubdue the Iſraelites, that they were in diſorder, and the Laws were not put in uſe. And therefore it is juſtly to be preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that the exact practice of this Law, on which, that of all the reſt depended, took not place, till <hi>Joſaphat</hi> applied the coactive power, then in his hands, to bring to effect,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:115786:119"/> that which God had eſtabliſhed in point of Divine right. The Conſiſtory then, by the Law, is commanded to judge the People: That is, the Soveraign Power of the people, is commanded to eſtabliſh the Conſiſtory: <hi>Joſaphat</hi> finds this command to take hold upon him, as having the Power of that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in his hands. So again, God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that Idolaters ſhould be put to death, and their Cities deſtroied, the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory inquiring, and ſentencing, as appears by the Jews Conſtitutions in <hi>Maimoni,</hi> of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, <hi>cap.</hi> IV. <hi>Deut.</hi> XIII. 2, 13, 14. But, ſuppoſe the diſeaſe grown too ſtrong for the cure, (as we muſt needs ſuppoſe the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory unable, to deſtroy an Idolatrous City, when moſt Cities doe the like; or to take away High Places, when the Land is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run with them) then muſt the coactive Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Secular arm, either reſtore the Law, or be branded to poſterity, for not doing it, as you ſee, the Kings of Gods people are. The Precept of building the Temple, was given to the Body of the People, therefore it takes hold upon <hi>David,</hi> and the Powers under him, <hi>his Princes, his Officers, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,</hi> 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> XIII. 2. XXVIII. 1. In fine, the Conſiſtory, by the Law, was to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine matters undetermined in the Law, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in generall, by giving Laws in queſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:115786:120"/> caſes, or in particular, by ſentencing cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: But, if the people ſlide back, and caſt away the yoke of the Law, none but the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Power can reduce them under the Covenant of the Law, to which they are born. Therefore, that Covenant is renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by <hi>Aſa,</hi> by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> by <hi>Joſias,</hi> by none but the King, as firſt it was eſtabliſhed by <hi>Moſes, King in Jeſurun, Deut.</hi> XXIX. 1. XXXIII. 5. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XV. 12, 14. XXIX. 10. XXXIV. 31. And, it is a very groſſe miſtake, to imagine, that the people renued it, or any part of it, without the conſent of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, under <hi>Eſdras</hi> and <hi>Nehemias, Eſd.</hi> XI. 1<hi>—Neh.</hi> X. 29—V. 12. For, <hi>Eſdras</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obtained that Commiſſion, which we ſee, <hi>Eſ.</hi> VII. 11—may well be thought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by eſtabliſhed, in the quality of Head of the Conſiſtory, by the Soveraign Power, as the Jews all report him: But howſoever, by that Commiſſion, we cannot doubt, that he was inabled to ſwear them to the Law, by which he was inabled to govern them in it, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ſuppoſing a grant, of full leave, to live according to their Law. But in <hi>Nehemias,</hi> we muſt acknowledge a further power, of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor under the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> as he cals himſelf expreſly, <hi>Neh.</hi> V. 14, 15. which qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſeems to me, anſwerable to that, of the Heads of the Captive Jews in <hi>Babylonia,</hi> of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:115786:120"/> whom we reade divers times in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> as well as in the Jews writings, that they were Heads of their Nation in that Country, having Heads of their Conſiſtories under them, at the ſame time, as <hi>Eſdras</hi> under <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemias.</hi> The proceedings then, of <hi>Eſdras</hi> and <hi>Nehemias,</hi> as well as of the Kings of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> prove no more, then that which I ſaid in the beginning of this Chapter, that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Powers have Right, to eſtabliſh, and reſtore, all matters of Religion, which can appear to be commanded by God. For, it is not in any common reaſon to imagine, that by any Covenant of the Law, renued by <hi>Eſdras</hi> and <hi>Nehemias,</hi> they conceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inabled, or obliged, to maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by force, in the profeſſion and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Religion, againſt their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, in caſe he had not allowed it them: Therefore, of neceſſity, that which they did, was by Power derived by Commiſſion from the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> (and ſo with reſervation of their obedience to them) who, granting <hi>Nehemias</hi> and <hi>Eſdras</hi> Power to govern the People in their Religion, muſt needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to grant them both, the free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and exerciſe of the ſame. But, having ſhewed, that the Church hath Power, by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right, to eſtabliſh, by a generall Act, which you may call, a Canon, Conſtitution,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115786:121"/> or Law, all that Gods Law determineth not, mediately, and by conſequence, I conceive it remains proved by theſe particulars done under the Old Teſtament, that the Church is to determine, but the determinations of the Church, to be maintained by the coactive Power of the Secular arm, ſeeing they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to effect, in any Chriſtian State, otherwiſe. Which alſo is immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by ſome acts, recorded in Scripture, whereby that is limited, which Gods Law had not determined. It is ſaid, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> XXV. 1. <hi>That David, and the Captains of the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, divided the ſonnes of Aſaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, to the ſervice of God.</hi> Here, it were an inconvenience to imagine, that Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Warre ſhould meddle with ordering the Tribe of Levi, and the ſervice of the Temple. It is not ſo: We are to underſtand there, by <hi>the Militia,</hi> the Companies of Prieſts, that waited on the Service of the Temple, the Captains of whom, with <hi>David,</hi> divided the Singers, as they did the Prieſts, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXIV. 3, 6, 7. Though elſewhere, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXIII. 6. <hi>David</hi> alone is mentioned to doe it, as, by whoſe Power, a buſineſſe concerning the ſtate of a Tribe in Iſrael, was put in effect and force. So, <hi>Hezekias</hi> and his Princes, and all the Synagogue, adviſed about holding the Paſſeover, in the ſecond
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:115786:121"/> moneth, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXX. 2. that is, he adviſed with the Conſiſtory, who are there, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> XXVI. 10, 11. called the Princes, for ſo the Jews Conſtitutions in <hi>Maimoni,</hi> in the Title of comming into the Sanctuary, <hi>ca.</hi> IV. teach us to underſtand it. So, <hi>David and his Princes, gave the Gibeonites, to wait upon the Levites;</hi> whereupon they are called <hi>Nethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim,</hi> that is, <hi>Given, Eſd.</hi> VIII. 20. where, by <hi>David</hi> and the Princes, we muſt underſtand by the ſame reaſon, <hi>David</hi> and the great Conſiſtory of his time. So alſo, <hi>Maimoni</hi> in the Title <hi>Erubin, ſubinit.</hi> or rather the Talmud Doctors, whoſe credit he followeth, tell us, that <hi>Solomon</hi> and his Conſiſtory brought that Conſtitution into practice, concerning what rooms meats may be removed into, upon the Sabbath. Herewith agrees the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Chriſtian Emperors, if we conſider the ſtyle, and character, of ſome of their Laws in the Codes, by which the reſt may be eſtimated: ſeeing it is not poſſible to confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all, in this abridgement. There, you ſhall finde a Law, by which, the Canons of the Church are inforced, and the Governors of Provinces tied, to obſerve and execute them, long before the Code of Canons, was made, by <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> a Law of the Empire. There you ſhall finde, the Audiences of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops eſtabliſhed, and the ſentences of them
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:115786:122"/> inforced by the Secular arm, the authority of them having been in force, in the Society of the Church, from the beginning, as hath been ſaid. There you ſhall finde Laws, by which men are judged Hereticks and Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, as they acknowledged the Faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by ſuch and ſuch Councels, or not, as they communicated with ſuch &amp; ſuch Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, or not: which, what is it, but to take the Act of the Church for a Law, and to give force to it by the Secular arm? Which, what prejudice can it import, to any Chriſtian State upon the face of the earth? For, firſt, ſuch Aſſemblies of the Church, at which publick matters are determinable, cannot meet, but by allowance of the State. In particular, though the Church hath Right to aſſemble Councels, when that appears the beſt courſe, for deciding matters in difference, yet, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid, that the Church was ever able to aſſemble a generall Councell, without the command of Chriſtian Princes, after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great. And this is the State of Religion, for the preſent, in Chriſtendome. The Power of determining matters of Religion, reſts, as always it did, in the reſpective Churches, to be tied, by thoſe determinations: But, the Power to aſſemble, in freedome, thoſe judgements, which may be capable to conclude the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:115786:122"/> Church, muſt reſt in the free agreement of the Soveraignties in Chriſtendome. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it hath been cautioned afore, that all Soveraign Powers have right to ſee, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that nothing be done in prejudice to their Eſtates, but alſo in prejudice to that which is neceſſary to the ſalvation of all Chriſtians, or that which was from the beginning eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the Church, by our Lord and his Apoſtles. Therefore, when Councels are aſſembled, neither can they proceed, nor conclude, ſo, as to oblige the Secular Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, either of Chriſtendome, or of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Soveraignties, but by ſatisfying them, that the determinations, which they deſire to bring to effect, are moſt agreeable to that which is determined by Divine Right, as well as to the Peace of the State. And ſo the objection ceaſes, that by making the Church independent upon the State, as to the matter of their Laws and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we make two Heads in one Body. For, ſeeing there is, by this determination, no manner of coactive Power in the Church, but all in the State, (for Excommunication conſtrains, but upon ſuppoſition, that a man reſolves to be a Chriſtian) there remains but one Head, in the Civile Society of every State, ſo abſolute, over the perſons that make the Church, that the independent power
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:115786:123"/> thereof, in Church matters, will enable it, to do nothing againſt, but ſuffer all things from the Soveraign. And yet, ſo abſolute, and depending on God alone, in Church matters, that if a Soveraign, profeſſing Chriſtianity, ſhould not onely forbid the profeſſion of that Faith, or the exerciſe of thoſe Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which God hath required to be ſerved with, but even the exerciſe of that Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Power, which ſhall be neceſſary to preſerve the Unity of the Church, it muſt needs be neceſſary, for thoſe that are truſted with the Power of the Church, not only to diſobey the commands of the Soveraign, but to uſe that Power, which their quality, in the Society of the Church, gives them, to provide for the ſubſiſtence thereof, without the aſſiſtance of Secular Powers. A thing manifeſtly ſuppoſed, by all the Biſhops of the Ancient Church, in all thoſe Actions, wherein they refuſed to obey their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors ſeduced by Hereticks, and to ſuffer their Churches to be regulated by them, to the prejudice of Chriſtianity: Particularly, in that memorable refuſall of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to admit the Heretick <hi>Arius</hi> to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at the inſtant command of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great. Which moſt Chriſtian action whoſoever juſtifies not, beſides the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:115786:123"/> of favour to ſuch an Hereſie, he will lay the Church open to the ſame ruine, whenſoever the Soveraign Power is ſeduced by the like. And, ſuch a difference falling out, ſo that, to particular perſons, it cannot be clear, who is in the Right, it will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for Chriſtians, in a doubtfull caſe, at their utmoſt perils, to adhere to the Guides of the Church, againſt their lawfull Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns, though to no further effect, then to ſuffer for the exerciſe of Chriſtianity, and the maintenance of the Society of the Church in Unity.</p>
               <p>Now, what ſtrength and force, the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the Keys, which is the Juriſdiction of the Church, neceſſarily requires from the Secular arm, may appear, in that this Power, hath been, and may be inforced, by Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns of contrary Religions. The firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Excommunication among the Jews, is, as you have ſeen, under <hi>Eſdras,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by Commiſſion from the King of <hi>Perſia.</hi> In the Title of both Codes, of <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius, De Judae is &amp; Coelicolis,</hi> you have a Law of the Chriſtian Emperors, whereby, the Excommunications of the Jews are enacted, and enforced, by forbidding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour powers to make them void. And, thus was the ſentence of the Church againſt <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus,</hi> ratified by the Heathen
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:115786:124"/> Emperour <hi>Aureliane,</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> his Hiſtories, VII. 30. For, though the matter thereof were not evident to him, that was no Chriſtian, yet, the authority might be, the ſupport whereof, concerned the Peace of the Empire. And ſo it was evident in that caſe: For there being a difference in the Church of <hi>Antiochia;</hi> between the Biſhop, and ſome of the Clergy and People, and the Synod there aſſembled, having condemned and depoſed the Biſhop; if this depoſition were allowed by the Synod of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> no man will deny, that there was thereby ſufficient ground, for him that was no Chriſtian, to proceed, and take away poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Church, and Biſhops houſe, from him that by ſuch authority was depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And thus, you ſee how true it is which I ſaid, that in Chriſtian States, the Power of the Church cannot be in force, without the Soveraign, becauſe Excommunication, which is the Sword thereof, and the laſt execution of this ſpirituall Juriſdiction, might be made void otherwiſe. As for the prejudice, which may come to a Chriſtian State, by a Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, not depending upon it in point of right, but only in point of fact, there ſeem to be two conſiderable difficulties made: The firſt, the Excommunication of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign: Ormore generally thus, that the Keys
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:115786:124"/> of the Church may then interpoſe in State matters: The ſecond, in regard that I have ſhewed, that, by the words of our Lord, this Power may take place in matters of intereſſe between party and party: For if in any, why not in all? and if in all, where ſhall the ſecular Power become, that Power that is able to judge all cauſes, being able to govern any State? To the firſt, the anſwer is evident, that, ſo farre as Excommunication concerns barely the Society of the Church, any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, capable of Soveraign Power, is liable to it, upon the ſame terms as other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are, becauſe, comming into the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church, upon the ſame condition as other Chriſtians, the failing of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, muſt needs render the effect void. But, if we conſider, either the temporall force, by which it comes to effect, or the temporall penalties which attend on it, to theſe, which cannot proceed, but by the will of the Soveraign, it is not poſſible that he ſhould be liable. Thus I had rather diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, then, between the greater Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication and the leſſe, as ſome doe, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Soveraign cannot be ſubject to the greater, but to the leſſe. For there is, indeed, but one Excommunication, as there is but one Communion, abſtinence from the Euchariſt, being no permanent but a tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115786:125"/> eſtate, under which whoſoever comes, if he give not ſatisfaction to the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes contumacious, and ſo, liable to the laſt ſentence. Let no man marvell at the good Emperour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> giving ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his penitence to the holy Biſhop S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe.</hi> The reaſon was, becauſe Chriſtianity, then freſh from the Apoſtles, was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and uncorrupt. It was underſtood, that he held not his Empire, by being of the Church, nor, that his ſubjects ought him any leſſe obedience, for not being of it. He that taught him to be ſubject to God, taught his people alſo, to be ſubject to him for Gods ſake, as Chriſtians always were to Heathen Emperours, even Perſecutors. Which, if it were received, it is not imaginable, that the Powers of the world could be prejudiced by any cenſure of the Church. As for the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that excommunicate perſons are not to be converſed with, by S. <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, it is anſwered by all Divines, that it ceaſes, in ſuch relations (for example, of Parents, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) as are more ancient then the Society of the Church, which it therefore preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: and ſo is to ceaſe, in things neceſſary to civile Society, which Chriſtianity, as it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth, ſo it inforceth, and not overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. In like manner, it is to be ſaid, that all proceedings, either of the Popes, or of the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115786:125"/> Scottiſh Presbyteries, in thoſe caſes which <hi>the burthen of Iſſachar</hi> mentions, are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the corruption, or miſunderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Chriſtianity. For, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, that ſome things, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſo muſt we ſay, that thoſe things onely exclude from the Church, which, by the very nature and eſſence of them, are inconſiſtent with Chriſtianity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe things, which a Chriſtian renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when he is admitted into the Church. Now, the affairs of States, ſuch as are, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and alliances with forein States, reaſon of Government at home, in Juriſdiction, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Laws, and commands of State, are ſuch things, as are not neceſſarily bad or good, but may be the ſubject either of virtue or vice: much leſſe, can it be manifeſt, not only to the Body of Chriſtians, but even to the Guides of the Church, when Governours forſake, and when they cleave to their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, though it is certain, that they doe either the one or the other always. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for particular actions, of the ſame kinde with thoſe, for which private perſons are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, when they become notorious, Princes alſo, and publick Perſons are ſubject to the cenſure of the Church. But for publick Government, the reaſon whereof muſt not be known, the kinde thereof, in the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:115786:126"/> being capable of good as well as bad; it is nothing but the miſunderſtanding and corruption of Chriſtianity, that ingages the Church in them, by the fault of thoſe, that by their quality in the Church, ſeek to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſome intereſſe in publick affairs, which Chriſtianity generally denies to be due. And, the ſame is to be ſaid of them, that make publick affairs, the ſubject of their prayers and Preaching. Which, though it may be done to good purpoſe, and in oppoſition to worſe, yet, ſeeing Chriſtianity requires, not only that it may be ſo in the Church, but alſo that it may not be otherwiſe, as it muſt needs proceed from a decay of Chriſtianity, ſo it muſt needs tend to the utter ruine of it. As for the drawing of Civile cauſes, to the cogniſance of Eccleſiaſticall Judicatories, by ſome things that have been ſaid, or done, to the advancement of the Presbyteries in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or here, it appears there is cauſe of ſcruple: But it is becauſe the reaſon is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, upon which our Lords ſaying proceeds. For, if the reaſon, why our Lord will have the differences of Chriſtians ended within the Church, is, that thoſe that are without, may not take notice, of the offences that are among Chriſtians, this will not hinder Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to plead before Chriſtians, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, will hinder no Juriſdiction of civile
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:115786:126"/> States, as ceaſing ſo farre as the State be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Chriſtian. Wherefore, it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, that the Audiences of Biſhops, have been, by the Laws of the Empire, and other Chriſtian States ſucceeding the ſame, limited to ſuch kinds of cauſes, as ſeemed to ſtand moſt upon conſideration of charity, and ſo, fitteſt to be ſentenced by the Church. But Matrimoniall cauſes, ſeem to me neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily to belong to this cogniſance: Becauſe of that particular diſpoſition, which, our Lord, in his Goſpel, hath left concerning Mariage. For, if this be peculiar to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as Chriſtians, then, whatſoever becomes queſtionable, upon the interpretation of this Law, concerning the Church, as it is the Church, muſt needs fall under the ſentence of thoſe, that are inabled to conclude the Society of the Church. And therefore, it is without queſtion, as ancient as Chriſtianity, that no Mariage be made which the Church alloweth not, the Benediction whereof upon Mariages, is a ſign of the allowance of the Church preſuppoſed; as that upon the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of <hi>Booz</hi> and <hi>Ruth, Ruth</hi> IV. 11. preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the act to be allowed by the Elders or Conſiſtory of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> as you have it afore. Theſe difficulties thus voided, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that the Secular Powers ſtand bound in conſcience, to inforce the Juriſdiction of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:115786:127"/> the Church, where the exerciſe of it, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth nothing contrary to the principles of Chriſtianity, or the quiet of the State.</p>
               <p>As for the intereſſe of the State in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, the ſame reaſon holds. It is very manifeſt, by many examples, of commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble times, under Chriſtian Emperors, that many Ordinations have been made, at the inſtance, and command of Emperors and Soveraign Princes. And why not? what hindreth them, to make choice of fitter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, then the Clergy and People can agree to chooſe? And what hindreth the Church, upon conſideration of their choice, to reform their own? But, when Soveraign Powers, by Generall Laws, forbid Ordinations to proceed, but upon perſons nominated by themſelves, how then ſhall the Right of the Church take place? or what ſhall be the effect of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> precept to <hi>Timothy, To lay hands haſtily on no man, leſt he partake of other mens ſins?</hi> Which cannot take place, unleſſe he that Ordain, be free not to Ordain. The Preſident <hi>Thuanus,</hi> writing of the Concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates between <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth and <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, (by which, the Canonicall way of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Biſhops was aboliſhed in <hi>France)</hi> ſaith freely, that that great Prince, never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered after that Act: giving this for his reaſon, becauſe thereby, that courſe of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:115786:127"/> Biſhops was taken away, which had been introduced from the beginning by the Apoſtles. In fine, of this particular, I ſhall need to ſay no more but this, according to the generall reaſon premiſed, that, qualities ordained by the conſtitution of the Church, are to be conferred by perſons qualified ſo to doe, by the conſtitution of the Church: But, with this moderation, that Secular Powers be ſatisfied, not onely, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons promoted, be not prejudiciall to the Peace of the State, whereof they have charge, by their proper qualities, but alſo, that, as Chriſtians, they be not aſſiſtant, to the promotion of thoſe, who profeſſe the contrary of that, which they, as Chriſtians, profeſſing, are bound to maintain.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, it will not be difficult, from the premiſes to determine the intereſſe of the State, in ſetling, maintaining, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the indowment of the Church. For, ſeeing the reaſons premiſed, (which now are laught at, by thoſe that will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand wherein Chriſtianity conſiſts) have prevailed ſo far, with all Chriſtian people, that all Tithes, and many other Oblations and Indowments, are, and have been, in all parts, conſecrated to God, as the Firſt-fruits of Chriſtians goods, for the maintenance of his Service; it remains the duty of the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:115786:128"/> Sword, to maintain the Church in that right. For, that publick Power, that ſhall lay hands on ſuch goods, ſhall rob both God and the People: God, in reſpect of the Act of Conſecration, paſt upon ſuch goods: the People, in reſpect of the Originall right and reaſon of the Church, which firſt moved Chriſtians to conſecrate the ſame: By vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of which right, that which firſt was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, being taken away by force, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an people remain no leſſe obliged, to ſeparate from the remainder of their poverty, that which ſhall be proportionable to that, which all Chriſtian people have always conſecrated to God, out of their eſtates. And, thoſe, that perſwade good Chriſtians, that ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations, have proceeded only from the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenage of the Clergy, for their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, may as well perſwade them, that they were couſened, when they were perſwaded to be Chriſtians, ſeeing ſuch conſecrations have been made, by all Chriſtian people. As for the diſpoſing of that which is given to the publick uſe of the Church, I ſay not the ſame. I hold it neceſſary, that the Church ſatisfie the State, that, whatſoever is given to ſuch uſe, may be to the common good of the people, and ſo leave the imperfection of Laws to blame, that it is not. A thing which I think may very reaſonably be done. For
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:115786:128"/> firſt, all Cathedrall Churches, being by the inſtitution of the Apoſtles, intire Bodies in themſelves, diſtinct from other Churches, according to that which hath been proved of the dependence of Churches, all Oblations to any Church, originally, belong to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy thereof in common, at the diſpoſing of the Biſhop and Presbyters thereof, which is known to have been the Primitive Order of the Church, derived from the practice of the Apoſtles, which I have declared out of the Scriptures. Though they have complied with the bounty of thoſe, that have indowed Pariſh Churches, and conſented to limit the indowments of every one of them, to it ſelf alone. Secondly, it is manifeſt, that the Clergy, are under ſuch a Diſcipline of the Primitive Church, that, ſo long as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to live in ſuch a diſcipline, they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther waſte the indowment of the Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves, nor uſe it to the advancement of their Families: Which Diſcipline, if the Secular Power be imploied to retrive, it will not be thereby, deſtructive to the Power of the Church, but cumulative. As likewiſe, if it be imploied to the moſt advantageous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution, of that maſſe of Church goods, which lies affected, and deputed to any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall Church, through the whole Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe thereof, in caſe the diſtribution made by
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:115786:129"/> Humane Right, appear prejudiciall to thoſe charitable purpoſes, which are the means, by which, the Service of God, through that Church or Dioceſe, is maintained and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced. Provided always, that a greater Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege be not committed, by robbing the Biſhop and Presbyters, of the Right and Power, which they have from the Apoſtles; in diſpoſing of the indowment of their Church. Theſe things promiſed, it is eaſie to undertake, that there never was ſo great a part of the fruits of this Land, mortified, and put out of commerce, and applied and affected to the Church, but that it was, in that eſtate, more advantageous to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſtrength, ſecurity, and plenty of the Nation, as well as to the ſervice of God, and the charitable maintenance of thoſe that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, in caſe the Secular Power had been improved, to diſpoſe of it for the beſt, then it can be, in any particular hands, eſpecially in the hands of Sacrilege.</p>

All Warre made upon the Title of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, is unjuſt, and deſtructive to it: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Religion cannot be Reformed by force. Of the preſent State of Chriſtianity among us, and the means that is left us, to recover the Vnity of the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THat which hath been ſaid, as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the preſent caſe of this Church, ſeems to be liable to one main Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which is this: That if the power of Biſhops and Presbyters be ſuch as hath been ſaid, by Divine Right, that nothing can be done without them, in their reſpective Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, it will follow, that, in caſe the State of the Church be corrupt, by proceſſe of time, and their default eſpecially, ſo that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good of the Church require Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by changing of Laws in force; if they conſent not, it cannot be brought to paſſe without breach of Divine Right. This may well ſeem to be the falſe light, that hath miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:115786:130"/> well affected perſons, to ſeek the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation preſently pretended. For ſeeing it is agreed upon among us, that there was a time and a State of the Church which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Reformation, and that, if the Clergy of that time had been ſupported in that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which, by the premiſes, is challenged on behalfe of the Clergy, this Reformation could not have been brought to paſſe: It ſeems therefore to the moſt part of men, that diſtinguiſh not between cauſes and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſes, that where Reformation is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, there the power lawfully in force to the Society of the Church, ought to ceaſe, that the Reformation may proceed, either by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular power, or if that conſent not, by force of the People. To ſtrengthen this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to the Reformation of this Church, it may further be ſaid, that, though it is true, that the Order of Biſhops hath been propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in this Church, at and ſince the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, by Ordinations made according to the form of that Apoſtolicall Canon, <hi>That a Biſhop be Ordained by two or three Biſhops;</hi> yet, if we judge of the Originall intent of that Canon, by the generall practice of the Church, it will appear, that it is but the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement of the IV Canon of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Nice, which requireth, that all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops be Ordained by a Councell of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:115786:130"/> of the Province: Which, becauſe it cannot always be had, therefore it is provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that two or three may doe the work, the reſt conſenting, and authorizing the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. A thing which ſeems neceſſarily true, by that which hath been ſaid, of the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Churches, conſiſting in this, that the Act of part of the Church obliges the whole, becauſe that part which it concerns, and the Unity of the whole which it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, ſtands firſt obliged by it, being done according to the Laws of the whole. By which reaſon, the Act of Ordination of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, obliges the whole Church to take him for a Biſhop, becauſe the Mother Church to which he belongs, and the reſt of Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall Churches under the ſame, do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it. And this is that which the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Apoſtles hath provided, to keep the Viſible Communion of the whole Church in Unity. To which it is requiſite, that a Chriſtian communicate with the whole Church, as a Chriſtian, a Biſhop Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter or Deacon, as ſuch. But when among the Biſhops of any Province, part conſent to Ordinations, part not, the Unity of the Church cannot be preſerved, unleſſe the conſent of the whole follow the conſent of the greater part. And therefore, though the Canon of Nice be no part of Divine Right,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:115786:131"/> yet ſeeing the precept of the Unity of the Church, (being the end which all the Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Laws of Church Government aim at) obligeth before any Poſitive precept of the Government thereof, which we ſee are many ways diſpenſed with for preſervation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and that it appears to be the generall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Primitive Church, to make Ordinations, at thoſe Provinciall Councels, which by another Apoſtolicall Canon XXXVIII, were to be held twice a year, it ſeemeth, that there can no valid Ordination be made, where the greater number of the Biſhops of the Province diſſent. Which is confirmed by the Ordination of <hi>Novatianus</hi> for Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> which, though done by three Biſhops, (as the Letter of <hi>Cornelius</hi> to the Eaſtern Biſhops, recorded by <hi>Euſebius Eccleſ. Hiſt.</hi> VI. 43. teſtifieth) yet was the foundation of that great Schiſme, becauſe <hi>Cornelius</hi> was Ordained on the other ſide by ſixteen, as we reade in S. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> Now it is manifeſt, that the Ordinations by which that Order is propagated in <hi>England,</hi> at and ſince the Reformation, were not made by conſent of the greater part of Biſhops of each Province, but againſt their minde, though they made no contrary Ordinations. And by the ſame means it is manifeſt, that all thoſe Eccleſiaſticall Laws, by which the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:115786:131"/> Reformation was eſtabliſhed in <hi>England,</hi> were not made by a conſent capable to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the Church, if we ſet aſide the Secular Power, that gave force unto that which was done, contrary to that Rule wherein the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church conſiſteth. But in other parts, the Reformation eſtabliſhed was ſo far from being done by Biſhops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or any conſent able to conclude the Church, by the Conſtitution of the Church, that the very Order of Biſhops is laid aſide and forgot, if not worſe, that is, deteſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them Upon which precedent it ſounds planſibly with the greateſt part among us, that, the Unity of the whole being diſſolved by the Reformation, the Unity of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation cannot be preſerved, but by diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Order of Biſhops among us.</p>
               <p>Before I come to reſolve this difficulty, it will be requiſite to examine, what Privileges and Penalties, the Secular Power is enabled to enforce Religion within a Chriſtian State: Becauſe it hath been part of the diſpute of this time, that ſome Privileges of the Church are contrary to Chriſtianity, as alſo ſome Penalties upon matter of Conſcience: And the reſolution of it will make way to my anſwer. Now the reſolution hereof muſt come from the ground laid from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Diſcourſe, that Chriſtianity im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:115786:132"/> no temporall Privilege, or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of this preſent World; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that Chriſtianity enableth no man to advance and propagate his Chriſtianity by force. For, as it is contrary to the nature thereof to bee forced, ſeeing the Service of God which it requireth, is not performed by any man that is not willing to doe it, nor the Faith beleeved, but by them that are willing to beleeve it: So, ſeeing it gives no man any privilege of this world, which he cannot challenge by a lawfull title of Humane Right, and that no title of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Right can enable any man, to impoſe upon another that Faith which Humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon reveals not, therefore can no Humane power force any man to be a Chriſtian, by the utmoſt penalty of death: which is that which force endeth in, to them that ſubmit not. It is true, the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> impoſeth death for a penalty in two caſes of Religion; the firſt of Idolaters, the ſecond of thoſe that diſobey the Conſiſtory. But it is to be conſidered, that Idolatry is a ſin which the light of nature convinceth, and is always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the conſequences of ſuch horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſins, as the Apoſtle declareth, that God ſuffered the Gentiles to fall into, for their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatries, in the beginning of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes.</hi> Beſides, that Penalty, by the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:115786:132"/> Law, lies, but in reſpect of the ſeven Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whom God, (for their Idolatries, and the conſequences thereof, ſuch as I have mentioned) gave up to deſtruction by the ſword of his people, on whom he beſtowed their inheritance: And in reſpect of Iſraelites, whom God having entred into Covenant with, on condition to ſerve him alone, had thereupon endowed with Secular power, to puniſh the tranſgreſſors of it. So that the power of inflicting death in theſe caſes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth upon the ſentence of deſtruction and death, pronounced by God againſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Nations, and committed to the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his People: And, upon the Soveraign power eſtated upon the people, by virtue of their Covenant with God: Which, though more then Humane for the Originall, yet muſt needs be available, according to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Right, to the ſame effect, which the ſame Power, eſtabliſhed by Title of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Right, is able to produce. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, this Penalty, by theſe Laws, cannot belong to any, that abſolutely refuſe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Chriſtianity. Beſides, it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that thoſe acts which this Law puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes with death, are ſpecified by the Law, to be the <hi>worſhipping of the Sun and Moon, and other Gods, Exod.</hi> XXII. 20. <hi>Deut.</hi> XVII. 3. the perſwading to worſhip other Gods, and,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:115786:133"/> for Cities to fall from God to doe it, <hi>Deut.</hi> XIII. 5, 6, 12. and therefore this puniſhment cannot be extended to other Acts, which, by interpretation and conſequence, may be argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the generall nature, or rather notion of Idolatries. A thing neceſſary to be ſaid, becauſe it is manifeſt, that there have been thoſe, that have made reading Service or a Sermon, much more kneeling at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, Idolatry, who, if they ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to improve their madneſſe, to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence which naturally it produceth, muſt proceed to deſtroy Civile Society, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying all them, whom, in their madneſſe, they take for Idolaters, as that wretched per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon did his Father, for perſwading him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Communion kneeling. As for thoſe that diſobeyed the Conſiſtory, it is to be remembred, that hath been formerly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that Religion, and the Civile State of Gods ancient people, made but one Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, by virtue of the Law, that eſtated them in the Land of Promiſe, upon condition of worſhipping God, and governing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Civile life according to the ſame: By conſequence whereof, whoſoever ſhould refuſe to ſtand to that judgement, which God by the Law appointeth, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the differences which ſhould ariſe about the interpretation, and limitation
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:115786:133"/> of that which the Law had not expreſſed, muſt indanger a breach among the people, which, it is all one, whether you call Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion or Schiſm. Now, it is no inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to grant, that, whoſoever ſhall pretend, under the Title of Chriſtianity, to trouble the Civile peace of that people and State wherein he liveth, be thought guilty of ſuch puniſhment, as the height of his offence ſhall deſerve. Becauſe, as this crime is moſt capitall, as neareſt concerning the publick, ſo is it moſt manifeſt, that Chriſtianity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be wronged by the puniſhment of it, ſeeing it hath been ſhewed, that Chriſtianity enableth no man to trouble the publick peace. So that, if any man make it a part of his Religion, to maintain his Religion by force, being by ſuch profeſſion fallen from the innocence of Chriſtianity, he is juſtly expoſed to the violence of all temporall Laws, that puniſh thoſe which trouble the publick peace. This is the caſe of them, that thought themſelves tied in conſcience, by the Bull of <hi>Pius</hi> the fift againſt Q. <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth;</hi> and it is the caſe of all them, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any title of Religion whatſoever, pretend to maintain the profeſſion or exerciſe thereof by faction or force. For, it is eaſie to ſee, that the Primitive Chriſtians maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo againſt the Gentiles, that, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:115786:134"/> them no Chriſtians, yet it doth appear, that they could not rightfully perſecute them for their Chriſtianity. Which none can maintain, but thoſe, that profeſſe to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert their Chriſtianity, by nothing elſe, but by ſuffering for it. And here it is worth our noting, that about the time of our Lord, there was a Conſtitution of the Conſiſtory, againſt <hi>Rebellious Elders,</hi> as they call them, (that is, ſuch as, having attained the degree of <hi>Doctors of the Law,</hi> ſhould Teach any thing to be lawfull or unlawfull by the Law, contrary to the determination of the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory) that they ſhould be put to death, as you may ſee in <hi>Maimoni,</hi> in that Title. Which, how far it was ever in force, is hard to be ſaid, becauſe, by the Goſpels we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the Nation had not power of life and death at that time. For, that it was about that time that they ſay it was eſtabliſhed, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, becauſe they report it to have been made in regard of the differences then on foot between the Scholars of <hi>Hillel</hi> and <hi>Sammai,</hi> which we know were not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Lords time. This Conſtitution is nothing elſe, but the limitation of that which the Law of <hi>Deut.</hi> XVII. 8. eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth, to particular circumſtances. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuppoſition of this Conſtitution it is, that our Lord expreſſeth the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:115786:134"/> 
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> Law and his Goſpel, when he ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> V. 19. <hi>He that ſhall break the leaſt of theſe Commandements, and teach men ſo, ſhall be leaſt in the Kingdome of heaven, but he that teacheth and doeth them, ſhall be great in the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> For the very terms of that Conſtitution, being death to him that ſhould <hi>both teach and doe</hi> contrary to the determination of the Conſiſtory, it is manifeſt, that our Lord, alluding to that Conſtitution of the Synagogue, declareth hereby, that, on the contrary, there is no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of death upon him that ſhould <hi>teach and doe</hi> contrary to his precepts, as thoſe of the Conſiſtory, but greater, that is, to be leaſt in the Kingdome of heaven. Whereby he ſheweth, that the Goſpel appointeth no temporall puniſhment to thoſe that break Chriſts precepts, but denies not that Civile States might. For the Goſpel, ſuppoſing and eſtabliſhing Civile Society, ſuppoſeth alſo thoſe Penalties without which it ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth not. And the puniſhment of thoſe that violate Civile Society, under the title of Chriſtianity, is not by the Goſpel, but by the Civile Power, which it preſuppoſeth, and voideth not, becauſe, Preaching, that Chriſtianity cannot be prejudiciall to States, it confirmeth, as to Chriſtianity, that power which all States have towards all Religions,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:115786:135"/> to ſee, that they prove not prejudiciall to the publick peace. We have then two caſes of Religion puniſhable with death: The firſt, when that which is contrary to the Law of Nature, is, by the corruption of naturall light, made matter of Religion, as hath been ſaid of Idolaters, and, as it may be ſaid of the whole ſpawn of Gnoſticks, from <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to the Manichees, their Heires and Succeſſors, which, as they corrupted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity with Heatheniſme, ſo, they tooke away the difference of good and bad, and brought in, under pretenſe of Religion, ſuch horrible uncleanneſſe as nature abhorres: Which being, by miſtake of the Gentiles, impoſed upon the Primitive Chriſtians, as, by the defenſe which they make for themſelves, they doe evidence ſufficiently, that they are wronged by thoſe reports, ſo they declare, that if they were true, they would not refuſe the perſecutions which they plead againſt. The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> caſe is, when any thing prejudiciall to Civile Society, is held and profeſſed as part of Chriſtianity. For, as that which is prejudiciall to the publick Peace, muſt needs be puniſhable by thoſe Powers, which are truſted with the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of publicke Peace, and that with the utmoſt puniſhment, when the caſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it: So it is certain, that it is not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:115786:135"/> which is puniſhed in ſo doing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſtianity contains nothing prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to Civile Society and publick Peace. Setting theſe caſes aſide, if no man can be conſtrained by capitall puniſhment to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Chriſtian, it followeth, that no Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, Schiſmatick, or Apoſtate from Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity can be puniſhable with death, meerly for the opinion which he profeſſeth. The ſame reaſons rightly improved, ſeem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that no man is puniſhable by the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile death of Baniſhment from his native Country and People, meerly for an opinion, which he beleeveth and profeſſeth, though falſly, to be part of Chriſtianity. For, you ſee, there is a great difference between the caſe of the Law and the Goſpel; The Law is the condition of a Covenant between God and the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by which they were all eſtated in the Land of Promiſe, and every one in his ſeverall intereſſe in the ſame: So that, whoſoever ſhould renounce or violate the condition of this Covenant, which is the Law, muſt needs become liable to the puniſhment of Death, when the Law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth it; and therefore to that of Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or civile Death, or any leſſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the Law enableth to eſtabliſh it. But the Goſpel is the condition of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which tenders the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:115786:136"/> to all thoſe that imbrace and obſerve it: And therefore requires all Nations, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, States, and Commonwealths, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into one Society of the Church, meerly for the common ſervice of God, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the ſame Faith, and duty of the ſame obedience: But otherwiſe, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the ſame obligation, both of Civile and Domeſtick Society, as afore. Whereupon it follows, that as Chriſtians, imbracing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity freely, (becauſe it cannot be truly imbraced otherwiſe) purchaſe themſelves thereby no Right or Privilege, againſt the Secular Powers which were over them afore: So no Secular Powers that are Soveraign, by profeſſing Chriſtianity themſelves, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe any Right and Power, (as to God) of inforcing Chriſtianity upon their Subjects, by ſuch Penalties, as the Conſtitution of thoſe Civile Societies which they govern, enables them not to inflict, according to the common Law of all Nations. Wherefore, ſeeing common reaſon diſcovereth not the truth of Chriſtianity to us, and therefore the common Law of Nations enjoineth not Chriſtianity, as the condition of Civile Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, but that Civile Societies, as they ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted before Chriſtianity, ſo ſtill ſubſiſt upon principles, which, for their Originall, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, though for their perfection after it,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:115786:136"/> it ſeems, that the Soveraign Powers of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Societies, are not enabled to make Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, the condition of being a member of thoſe States which they govern. But if Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Powers be not enabled to puniſh the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of Chriſtianity, or of any part of it, with Naturall or Civile death, doth it therefore follow, that all men are, by Gods Law, to be left to their freedome, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and profeſſe what they pleaſe? I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there are very great Penalties, under the rate of thoſe, which the Conſtitution of Civile Societies, by the Common Law of Nations, will enable the Soveraign Powers thereof, to puniſh the neglect of Chriſtianity with, when they have avowed it for the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the States which they govern. For, in that caſe, the neglect of Chriſtianity, is not onely a ſin againſt God, and a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but againſt Civile Society, and that reverence which every man owes the Powers that conclude his own People, in thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the invaluable benefit of peaceable protection, which he enjoies by the ſame. Secondly, ſeeing that all Religion, excepting true Chriſtianity, is a moſt powerfull means of diſturbing the publick peace of civile So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, though perhaps it profeſſe no ſuch thing expreſly, it follows by conſequence, that all Powers, that are truſted with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:115786:137"/> of publick Peace, are enabled to forbid that which is not true Chriſtianity, by all penalties, under thoſe that have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. So that, when true Chriſtianity is forbidden under ſuch penalties, the fault ſhall be, not in uſurping, but in abuſing the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in applying it to a wrong ſubject, not in ſtraining it to that which it extendeth not to. And in ſo doing, that is, in ſuffering that which is ſo done, it is not to be thought that Chriſtianity can be wronged, though wrong be done to the men that are Chriſtians. For, ſeeing it is the common profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to bear Chriſts Croſſe, and ſeeing it was the diſpoſition of God, to advance Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity to the Stern of the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and to the Rule of other Chriſtian Kingdomes and Commonwealths, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating, that it was not prejudiciall to Civile Society, by the ſufferings of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians, it followeth, that, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a man holds for true Chriſtianity, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be demonſtrated to be ſo, as God hath appointed Chriſtianity to be demonſtrated, but by the ſufferings of them that profeſſe it. And therefore it remains agreeable to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that God hath given Secular Powers ſuch right to reſtrain pretended Chriſtianity, that when it is uſed againſt the true, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to be uſurped, but abuſed. It will
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:115786:137"/> be ſaid, for it is ſaid already, that any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint to Chriſtianity by temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will ſerve but to confirm ſome, and engage them to that which they have once profeſſed contrary to truth; and that others, who, to avoid puniſhment, ſhall outwardly ſubmit to what inwardly they approve not, muſt needs forfeit all power of Chriſtianity, by preferring the world before any part of it. To which it muſt be anſwered, that, all this granted, proves not that it is unjuſt, or that civile Powers have no right to make ſuch Laws, but that it is not expedient, the exerciſe of it, being, probably, to no good purpoſe, which defeats not the right, till it be proved, that it cannot be exerciſed to any good purpoſe: which in this point cannot be done. For, it is as probably ſaid on the other ſide, that, by temporall Penalties, a man is induced, to conſider with leſſe preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, that which the Law of his Country pretendeth to be for his good, and to reliſh it aright, when, upon due conſideration, it appears to be no otherwiſe: And ſo, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the Law, tends to the ſame purpoſe, as all afflictions are ſent by God, to drive men to their good againſt their will: And, that thoſe, who fainedly ſubmit to Chriſtianity, may, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, be Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnt by walking in the Sun, though they
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:115786:138"/> walk not in the Sun for that purpoſe: That is, by trying the effect of Chriſtianity, in the worſhip of God, and reformation of mens lives, among whom they live, by being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch Laws, may be won to imbrace it for it ſelf, which, at firſt, they imbraced for the worldly privilege of it. To which purpoſe, there can be no mean ſo effectuall, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of the publick diſcipline of Penance in the Church: By which it becomes moſt evident, what inward eſteem men ſet upon Chriſtianity, by the eſteem they ſet upon the Communion of the Church; And, that the ſentence of Excommunication is abhorred, not for the temporall Penalties, which, by civile Laws attend upon it, but for the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the Church, which it intercepteth, And truly, this laſt inconvenience of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall profeſſion, can by no means be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, whereſoever Chriſtianity, or any opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſuppoſed to be a neceſſary part of it, is made the Religion of any State. For evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence whereof, I muſt repeat firſt, that which was ſuppoſed afore, that there are but two reaſons, for which any Religion can be ſaid to be the Religion of any State, to wit, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges and Penalties. In the ſecond place, I muſt ſuppoſe here, that, as exemption from any penalty is a privilege, ſo exemption from a privilege is a penalty. Wherefore, ſeeing
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:115786:138"/> no Religion can be the Religion of any State, but by ſuch privileges, as another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is not capable of, it is manifeſt, that Toleration of Religion, as it is a Privilege, in compariſon of puniſhment, ſo it is a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in compariſon of that Religion which is privileged. Theſe things ſuppoſed, it will not be difficult to render a reaſon, why Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity muſt of neceſſity decay, and why the power of it is ſo decaied, ſince the world came into the Church. For when men came not to Chriſtianity, till they had digeſted the hardſhip of the Croſſe, and reſolved to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the next world afore this, it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, if they endured what they had foreſeen, and reſolved againſt. But, ſeeing temporall privilege, as well as temporall puniſhment, may belong to true Chriſtianity, no marvell if men follow the reaſon of privilege, not of Chriſtianity, when they goe both together, though, by conſequence, they will be ready to change as the privilege changes.</p>
               <p>Now, as to the Privileges which Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity is endowed with, by the Act of God, or made capable of by the ſame, from So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Powers, when they make Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity the Religion of thoſe States which they govern: It is very eaſie to reſolve from the premiſes, that the Clergy are not exempt by Divine Right from any Law of thoſe
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:115786:139"/> States under which they live. For, ſeeing the Clergy is a quality which preſuppoſeth Chriſtianity, and ſubſiſteth by virtue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and that no quality, ſubſiſting by the conſtitution of the Church, or by Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, endoweth any man with any temporall right, wherewith he is not inveſted, by the quality which he holdeth, in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, it followeth, that no man, by being of the Clergy, can be privileged againſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Power, or againſt thoſe Laws which are the Acts of it. And therefore, the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Abiathar</hi> High Prieſt, removed from his Office by <hi>Solomon,</hi> for Rebellion and Treaſon, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> II. 26. (to wit, becauſe, as it is there expreſſed, he had deſerved to be removed out of the world) is an effectuall argument to this purpoſe. For if that Office, to which his perſon was deſigned by Gods expreſſe Law, (ſuppoſing him to be lawfull High Prieſt) might be taken away for a crime committed againſt the Majeſty of the King, ſubſiſting by an Act ſubſequent to the Law eſtabliſhed by God, becauſe the Law which allowed a King, enjoined obedience by all the Penalties of the Law: And indeed, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Clergy is but a degree qualifying men in Chriſtianity above the People, thoſe temporall privileges, which by Divine right are pretended to belong to the Clergy, muſt
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:115786:139"/> needs belong to the People in an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our degree, by the ſame right: much more the Clergy, preſuppoſing the Church, as the Church the State, muſt needs leave all men that are qualified by it, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, upon the ſame termes as it findes them, to the States wherein they profeſſe themſelves Chriſtians. Which cannot be, when both Societies of the Church and the Commonwealth conſiſt of the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But, though the Clergy be not exempt from any Secular Juriſdiction by Divine Right, yet they are ſo capable of exemption by Divine Right, that no man can deny, the Privilege granted by the firſt Chriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, the Cauſes of the Clergy to be heard and determined within the Clergy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to be very agreeable to reaſon of Chriſtianity. For, if our Lord hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and the Apoſtles ordained, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of Chriſtians to be ended within themſelvs, that they might not prove a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall to Chriſtianity, it is but correſpondent &amp; conſequent thereunto, that, for avoiding the ſcandalls which the differences of the Clergy may occaſion, or to make them leſſe publick, they be ended within themſelves, ſeeing it is manifeſt to all underſtandings, that the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Clergy, is of great intereſſe to the advancement of Chriſtianity. On the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:115786:140"/> other ſide, ſeeing the Diſcipline which the Clergy are liable to by Chriſtianity, is ſo much ſtricter, then that which the Civile Laws of any Commonwealth whatſoever can require and determine, that Clergy men cannot incurre the penalties of Criminall Laws, but they muſt be ſuppoſed, to have violated the ſtricter diſcipline of the Church which they are under, afore: It follows, that it is ſo farre from Chriſtianity, to privilege them againſt ſuch Laws, that the Church cannot otherwiſe be cleared of the ſcandall, then by Eccleſiaſticall cenſures, correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the temporall puniſhments which they incurre. But if thus it be true, that no man by virtue of his Chriſtianity, is endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any Secular Privilege, of that Civile Society wherein he liveth: By the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it muſt be true, that no man is, by his Chriſtianity, uncapable of any Right, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all members of the State in which he liveth, unleſſe ſome Law of Chriſtianity can be produced, whereby it may appear, to be incompetible with the quality he holdeth in the Church. Which hath been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with much noiſe, to render the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of this Church uncapable of imploiment in Secular affairs, in point of Divine Right, but will be very difficult to prove by the Scriptures, in regard that Chriſtianity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:115786:140"/> nothing, but that which tendeth to the maintenance of Civile Society, as on the other ſide, Civile Society, and the Powers thereof, tendeth to the maintenance of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. Therefore, the words of our Lord, <hi>That his Diſciples ſhould not be as the Gentiles, among whom the great ones domineer over the reſt, and in ſo doing were called Gracious Lords, Mat.</hi> XX. 25. <hi>Mar.</hi> X. 42, 43. <hi>Luc.</hi> XXII. 25, 26. being ſpoken to his Diſciples as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, not as Apoſtles, in commendation of humility and meekneſſe, a quality concerning all Chriſtians, cannot prove the Clergy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden ſecular imploiment, but they muſt, by the ſame reaſon, inforce all Civile Power to be unlawfull among Chriſtians, as alſo, in the Society of the Church, all ſuperiority of power, as unlawfull, as that which is here challenged on behalf of Biſhops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. On the other ſide, that which they are ſuppoſed to deſtroy, they manifeſtly preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that is to ſay, a Superiority of power among the Diſciples of Chriſt, by the names of greater and leſſe, competible with the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Diſciples: And therefore concern not the lawfulneſſe of power, but the right uſe of it, and ſo, forbid no ſort of Chriſtians any power whereof any Chriſtian is capable. The words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> are more pertinent to this purpoſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> II. 4. for it is a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:115786:141"/> that he borroweth, from the cuſtome of the Romane Empire, wherein Soldiers, as they were exempted from being <hi>Tutors</hi> to mens perſons, or <hi>Curators</hi> to their eſtates, ſo they were forbidden to be <hi>Proctors</hi> of other mens cauſes, to undertake husbandry or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe. Therefore when S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to <hi>Timothy, No man that goeth to the army, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangleth himſelf in buſineſſe of the world, that he may pleaſe him that impreſted him;</hi> He rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes indeed a particular exhortation to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> upon a generall ground of reaſon, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the Romane Laws, that thoſe of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothies</hi> quality oblige not themſelves to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe inconſiſtent with it: But can he be underſtood hereby, to make that a Law to the Militia of the Church, which was a Law to the Militia of the Empire? Or can an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation drawn from a compariſon, be thought to create a generall Law to all of <hi>Timothies</hi> quality in generall or in particular, further then the reaſon of the compariſon will inferre in every particular caſe? It is true, that Soldiers were forbidden buſineſſe of profit, were exempted emploiments of publick ſervice, as was that of Tutors and Curators, becauſe thereby they became ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to the Laws, or to their own profit, to the prejudice of their attendance upon their colours: That is to ſay, that, for the great
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:115786:141"/> diſtance between Civile and Military emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in that State, the Laws had rendred Soldiers uncapable of ſuch qualities. And ſo it is confeſſed, that the Laws of the Church, the Canons, rendred the Clergy uncapable of the like, during the diſtance between the Church and the State not yet Chriſtian. For ſo we find, that in S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, Clergy men were forbidden to be Tutors or Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, for the like reaſon, becauſe their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Laws in that eſtate, would have excuſed them to the Church: And becauſe, that by reaſon of the diſtance between the State of the Church at that time, it could not tend to any publick good of the Society of the Church. But in States that profeſſe Chriſtianity, can it be ſaid, that the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Clergy men upon the affairs of the Commonwealth, cannot be to the publick good of the Church, conſiſting of all the ſame perſons, onely in a diſtinct reaſon and quality, whereof the Commonwealth conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth? To me it ſeems farre otherwiſe, that in all publick Aſſemblies of States, whether for making Laws, or for Juriſdiction, or for Counſell, or for preſervation of publick Peace, to baniſh thoſe from them, whoſe quality and profeſſion entitles them to the moſt exact knowledge and practice of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, is to baniſh the conſideration of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:115786:142"/> Chriſtianity, from the concluſions and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of thoſe Aſſemblies. For, though it be ſeen by experience, that the Clergy come ſhort of the holineſſe, and exact converſation in Chriſtianity, which they profeſſe, yet it will be always ſeen likewiſe, that the people fail more, and before them, and that they are firſt, corrupted, by and with the people, then, corrupters of the people. And, as for the ſervice of the Church, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attend upon in the mean time, ſuppoſing the Order here challenged, to be inſtituted by the Apoſtles, the inconvenience ceaſeth. For, ſuppoſing all Cathedrall Churches to be Corporations, truſted to provide for the government of all Congregations contained in, them in Church matters, and the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Offices of Divine Service at the ſame, whatſoever Clergy man ſhall, by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick imploiment, deſtitute his Congregation, ſhall leave it to the care of the Church ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally entruſted with it: Which Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, being all Nurſeries and Seminaries of Clergy, deſigned for the Service of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Bodies, may eaſily, by the means thereof, ſee all Offices diſcharged from time to time, to all Congregations which they contain. And this is that which I deſired to ſay here in generall, to this moſt difficult point, of the Privileges and Penalties, which
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:115786:142"/> Chriſtianity may be eſtabliſhed and enforced with by a State that profeſſes it: As for the particulars, which, upon thoſe generall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, may be diſputed in point of lawfull or unlawfull, as alſo, for the point of expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereby, that which in generall may be done, ought or ought not to be done when the caſe is put, I leave to them that are qualified and obliged, to proceed in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining the ſame.</p>
               <p>To come, then, to the great difficulty propoſed, it is to be acknowledged, that the Power of the Church, in the perſons of them, to whom it is derived by continuall ſucceſſion, is a Law ordained by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, for the unity and edification of the Church: So that no part of the Whole, can ſtand obliged by any Act, that is not done by the Councell and Synod of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, reſpective to that part of the Church which it pretendeth to oblige. But withall it is to be acknowledged, that there are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of other Laws, given the Church by our Lord and his Apoſtles, whether they concern matters of Faith, or matter of Works, whether immediately concerning the ſalvation of particular Chriſtians, or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the publick Order of the Church, which, proceeding from the ſame, if not a greater power then the Succeſſion of the Church,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:115786:143"/> are to be retained, all, and every one of them, with the ſame Religion and conſcience. And, with this limitation, the diſtinction which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is uſually anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with, is to be admitted, between ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Perſons and ſucceſſion of Doctrine; Not as if it were not a part of Chriſtian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that the Succeſſion of the Apoſtles is to be obeyed, as their Ordinance, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are many other points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine delivered the Church, by our Lord and his Apoſtles, all and every one of them equally to be regarded with it. Again, I have ſhewed, that the Secular Power is bound to protect the Eccleſiaſticall, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining all things, which are not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by our Lord and his Apoſtles, and to give force and effect to the acts of the ſame: But in matters already determined by them, as Laws given to the Church, if, by injury of time, the practice become contrary to the Law, the Soveraign Power being Chriſtian, and bound to protect Chriſtianity, is bound to imploy it ſelf, in giving ſtrength, firſt, to that which is ordained by our Lord and his Apoſtles. By conſequence, if thoſe whom the power of the Church is truſted with, ſhall hinder the reſtoring of ſuch Laws, it may and ought, by way of penalty to ſuch perſons, to ſuppreſſe their power, that ſo it
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:115786:143"/> may be committed to ſuch, as are willing to ſubmit to the ſuperiour Ordinance of our Lord and his Apoſtles. A thing throughly proved, both by the Right of Secular Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in advancing Chriſtianity with penalties, and in eſtabliſhing the exerciſe of it, and, in particular, by all the examples of the pious Kings of Gods people, reducing the Law into practice, and ſuppreſſing the contrary thereof. Seeing then, that it is agreed upon, by all that profeſſe the Reformation, that many and divers things ordained by our Lord and his Apoſtles, whether to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or to be practiſed in the Church, were ſo aboliſhed by injury of time, that it was requiſite they ſhould be reſtored, though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the will of thoſe, that bore that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which the Apoſtles appointed neceſſary to conclude the Church; it followeth, that, the neceſſity of Reformation inferreth not the aboliſhing of the Succeſſion of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but that more Laws of our Lord and his Apoſtles, and of more moment, were preferred before it, where it could not regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly be preſerved: Which, when it may be preſerved, is to be ſo far preſerved before all deſigns, which may ſeem to humane judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment expedient to the advancement of Chriſtianity, that whoſoever ſhall endevour, without ſuch cauſe, to deſtroy the power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:115786:144"/> from the Apoſtles, by conferring it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe, that ſucceed them not in it, and much more, whoſoever ſhall doe it to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Laws contrary to the Ordinance of the Apoſtles, ſhall be thereby guilty of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible crime of Schiſm. For it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that there are ſome things imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately neceſſary to the ſalvation of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Chriſtians, whether concerning Faith or good manners; and there are other things neceſſary to the publick order and peace of the Church, that by it Chriſtians may be edified in all matters of the firſt kinde. The denying of any point of the firſt kinde, may, for diſtinctions ſake, be called Hereſie, when a man is reſolute and obſtinate in it: But in the other kinde, it is not a falſe opinion that makes a man a Schiſmatick, till he agree to deſtroy the Unity of the Church for it. It can ſcarce fall out indeed, that any man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to deſtroy the Unity of the Church, without ſome falſe opinion in Chriſtianity: Yet it is not the opinion, but the deſtroying of a true, or erecting of a falſe power in the Church, that makes Schiſm. And it can ſcarce fall out, that any man ſhould broach a doctrine contrary to Chriſtianity, without an intent to make a Sect apart; yet, onely a falſe perſwaſion in matters neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is enough to make an Heretick. This
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:115786:144"/> is the reaſon, that both Hereſie and Schiſm, goes many times under the common name of Hereſies or Sects, among the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church. Otherwiſe, it is truly ſaid, that Hereſie is contrary to Faith, Schiſm to Charity: becauſe the crime of Hereſie is found in a ſingle perſon that denies ſome point of Faith, though the name of it be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, onely to thoſe, and to all thoſe that make Sects apart. In the mean time we muſt conſider that the word Schiſm, ſignifies the ſtate as well as the crime, in which ſenſe, all that are in the ſtate of Schiſm, are not in the crime of Schiſm, but thoſe that give the cauſe of it. For as it is reſolved, that Warre cannot be juſt on both ſides that make War, ſo is it true, that the cauſe of all diviſions in the Church muſt needs be only on one ſide, and not on both: And that ſide which gives the cauſe, are rightfully called Schiſmaticks, though both ſides be in the ſtate of Schiſm, as he in S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid of <hi>Tarquin</hi> and <hi>Lucrece,</hi> that being two in one act, yet one of them onely committed Adultery. If then, the Laws given by our Lord and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles be reſtored, by conſent of ſome part of the Councell and Synod, requiſite to oblige any reſpective part of the Church, and the Succeſſion of the Apoſtles propagated by them alone, in oppoſition to the reſt that
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:115786:145"/> conſent not unto them, the cauſe of Schiſm cannot lie on this ſide, which concurreth with the Primitive Succeſſion of our Lord and his Apoſtles, but upon them that violate the Communion of the Church, by refuſing ſuch Laws, and the right of ſuch perſons, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the ſame, the condition of the Unity and Communion of the Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting as much in the reſt of Laws given by our Lord and the Apoſtles, as in that of the Succeſſion and power of the Apoſtles: Which is the caſe of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But whoever, by virtue of any authority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven, ſhall uſurp Eccleſiaſticall Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſhall uſurp the Succeſsion of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and take it from them that rightfully ſtand poſſeſt of it, upon pretenſe of gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Church by ſuch Laws, as he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally perſwaded, but falſly, to be commanded the Church by our Lord and his Apoſtles, this whoſoever ſhall doe, or be acceſſory to, is guilty of Schiſm.</p>
               <p>The iſſue then, of this whole diſpute, ſtands upon this point, how, and by what means, it may be evidenced, what Laws of the Faith and Manners of particular Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, of the publick Order of the Church, have been given the Church by our Lord and his Apoſtles. A point which cannot be reſolved aright, but by them which reſolve
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:115786:145"/> aright, for what reaſons, and upon what grounds and motives they are Chriſtians. For without doubt, the true reaſons and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Chriſtianity, if they be purſued, and improved by due conſequence, will either diſcover the truth of any thing diſputable in the matter of Chriſtianity, or, that it is not determinable by any revealed truth. Here it is much to be conſidered, that the truth of things revealed by God, is not manifeſted to the mindes of them, to whom, and by whom God reveals them to the World, by the ſame means, as to them whom he ſpeaks to by their means. <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, our Lord and his Apoſtles, when they were ſent to declare the will of God to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, were firſt aſſured themſelves, that what they were ſent to declare to the world, was firſt revealed to themſelves by God, and then were enabled, to aſſure the world of the ſame. By what means they were aſſured themſelves, concerns me not here to enquire. It is enough, that they were always enabled to do ſuch works, as might aſſure the world, that they were ſent by God. For how could they demand of any man to beleeve them, till they ſhewed him a reaſon to beleeve? Indeed, though there can no reaſon be given why matters of faith are true, there may bee a reaſon given why they
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:115786:146"/> are credible; Becauſe many things are true, the reaſon whereof mans underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding comprehends not, yet God can ſhew him reaſon why he ſhould beleeve. Thus was the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> thus was the Goſpel of Chriſt advanced to the world and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, God having beſtowed on them that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced the one and the other, a power to do works, the greatneſſe and ſtrangeneſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of might be able to prevail over the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe things, which they propounded to be beleeved and obeyed. For though it is no inconvenience, that God ſhould grant revelations to many perſons, to whom he granteth not the power of doing ſuch works, as may ſerve to convince the world, that thoſe revelations are ſent by God: yet, that he ſhould imploy any man to declare unto the world, any thing that God requireth to be beleeved and obeyed, without any means to make evidence of his Commiſsion, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary reaſon will ſhew to be too groſſe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience. This being the motive of Faith in generall, the difficulty that remains will be, how it becomes evident to the ſenſes of all ages, all places, all perſons of the world, that can be obliged to receive the Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done and ſeen, onely by thoſe perſons that were ſent, and to whom. A difficulty endleſſe to thoſe, that adviſe not as they
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:115786:146"/> ſhould doe with their own common ſenſe. For it is manifeſt, that we receive an infinite number of truths, which never came under our own ſenſes, from the ſenſe of others, when we finde, all thoſe that have had the means to take ſenſible notice of them, agree in the ſame. Such are all things, that are, or are done, in any diſtance from any mans ſenſes, whereof he cannot be informed, but by Hiſtoricall faith. For all that is related from them that have ſeen, carries with it the credit of Hiſtoricall truth, as far as common ſenſe obliges to beleeve, that all that relate, can neither be deceived, nor agree to deceive. Whereupon, that which all agree in becoms unqueſtionable, becauſe it is as eaſie to know what may be ſeen, as it is unpoſſible, that all that agree in a report, ſhould agree in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to deceive. The common notions in <hi>Euclide</hi> are unqueſtionable; and is it more queſtionable, that there is ſuch a City as <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſuch a Country as <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> to thoſe that never were there? Would Phyſitians and Aſtronomers build their ſtudies, or be ſuffered to build their practice, upon experiments and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations related by particular perſons, did not common ſenſe aſſure, that men would not take the pains to abuſe others, onely to be laught at and deteſted themſelves? The
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:115786:147"/> queſtion then being, (to ſuppoſe a queſtion where there is none, becauſe there is a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what is the true anſwer) whether the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles recorded in the Scripture were done or not, neither could they that firſt received them agree to deceive or be deceived, but ſtood convict, becauſe they muſt have done violence to their own ſenſes otherwiſe, and, being once admitted unqueſtionable, to the worlds end they remain no otherwiſe. For, the effect of them continuing, in that the Law or the Goſpel is in force by virtue of them, they remain as certain, as he that ſees a City builded a thouſand years ſince, knows that there were men alive at the building of it. The Jews therefore are in the wrong, when they argue for the Law againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that, becauſe there never was, or indeed can ever be ſuch an appearance, of all them of one age, to whom the Goſpel is addreſſed, as there was of the Iſraelites, at the giving of the Law, when all of that age, that were to be tied by it, were preſent at once, to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that it was ſent from God, therefore no Law abrogating the ſame, can by any means become credible. For, as, for the love of this advantage againſt Chriſtianity, they deny that which the firſt ſending of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> expreſly affirmeth, <hi>Exod.</hi> IV. 5. that all the miracles which he was endowed with,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:115786:147"/> tended to win faith of the people, that God ſent him: And will have all the credit of the Law, to ſtand preciſely, upon the appearance and ſtanding of Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> as they call it, where they will have all the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to have been Prophets, of <hi>Moſes</hi> rank, whom God ſpoke face to face with, without any commotion or rapture of his or their ſenſes: So they conſider not, how the truth of this appearance of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> is manifeſted to their poſterity: Seeing that by the ſame means as it becomes evident to thoſe that live under other times, the motives of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity may alſo be conveyed and evidenced to them, that are not preſent at the doing of the works. This for the evidence: As for the ſufficience of the motives to the Goſpel, in compariſon of thoſe of the Law, the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility thereof neceſſarily follows upon Gods omnipotence: the actuality of it is ſufficiently proved, by the judgement of all Nations, that have imbraced the Goſpel, in compariſon of one that imbraced the Law. Eſpecially if we conſider the predictions of the Law and the Prophets going before, and the converſion of the Gentiles following upon the publication of the Goſpel: Which being reckoned among the miracles that render the Goſpel to be beleeved, doe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily bring all the motives of the Law, to
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:115786:148"/> depoſe for the truth of the Goſpel. Thus much premiſed, it will be poſsible to reſolve in a few words, the ſubject of voluminous diſputes. All men know, how thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> would have us beleeve and receive the Scriptures, upon the credit of the Church, affirming them to come from God: And conſequently, whatſoever the Church determines, to be the true meaning of the Scriptures, and the Word of God: So that there can be no true faith, in any man that disbeleeves any part of it: Whether by the Church they mean the Pope, or a Councell, or whoſoever they ſhall agree to have right to conclude the Church. On the other ſide, it were eaſie to ſay who they are, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to beleeve the Scriptures, upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate dictate of the Spirit of God to their ſpirit, that they come from God. And, though I cannot ſay, that, conſequently, they deny any man to have faith, that beleeves not all that their Spirit dictates to be the meaning of Gods word, becauſe the dictates of ſeverall Spirits are ſo contrary, that this can be no Rule: yet when the qualities of mens perſons, with the dictates of their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, are alledged in bar to the received do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church, it is manifeſt, that men expect ſuch light to be ſtruck out of the darkneſſe and confuſion of ſuch dictates,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:115786:148"/> that the Church ſhall at length be convinced to beleeve and receive it. And truly thoſe that profeſſe that they could not beleeve the Scriptures, but by the immediate dictate of the Spirit, by the ſame reaſon can conclude nothing to be the will of God, and the true intent of his Word, without it. This, if it were meant onely, of the teſtimony of the Spirit of God, witneſſing with our Spirit, that we are the children of God, and ſealing the aſſurance of this favour to our perſons and actions, then would it not take away the grounds upon which, and the means by which, we are effectually moved and brought to be Chriſtians, both in profeſſion and in deed: So that, by conſequence, means might be had, whereby a mans own Spirit might be enabled, to diſcern between the dictates of Gods Spirit, and that of the world. But being advanced in anſwer to this difficulty, as the firſt ground of faith, and the laſt reſolution of it, cannot be ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; But of neceſsity importeth, that no man can be aſſured, by the aſſurance of faith, of any truth, without that means, by which God reveals himſelf to them, by whom he declares his will to others. That either any perſon on behalf of the Church, or any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſpirit, ſhould pretend to any ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment, is contrary to common ſenſe, and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:115786:149"/> their own proceedings: When they uſe the like means to inform themſelves, both why to beleeve the Scripture, and what the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, and the will of God is, as other men doe. And, if they doe pretend more, they muſt ſhew ſuch evidence, as God hath ordained to convince the world, before they can pretend to oblige any man to beleeve them. Beſides, that ſo, it would not be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to render a reaſon, why God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his Scriptures at all, ſeeing that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, he muſt furniſh, either ſome perſons in behalf of the Church, or all beleevers, with revelations to convince them, what is his will and meaning by the Scriptures. But if they admit of ſuch means, as God hath appointed Chriſtians to decide, whether it be the Spirit of God, or of the world, that witneſſeth with their Spirit, then is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion where it was: Becauſe, as God gives his Spirit to thoſe that are Chriſtians, upon ſuch qualities, and to ſuch intents, as they who pretend to the Spirit of God, ought to finde in themſelves, and to propoſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and no other, ſo are they aſſured, that it is the Spirit of God, that moves them, becauſe they are aſſured of thoſe qualities and intentions in themſelves, and by no other meanes. Now, having ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, upon what grounds Chriſtianity
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:115786:149"/> is to be imbraced, I demand, whether it be in the compaſſe of any reaſon, that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the truth of Chriſtianity, to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether the Scriptures are to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or not. Certainly, he were a ſtrange man, that ſhould conſent to be a Jew, or a Mahumetane, and yet make a queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Book of the Law came from <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the Alcoran from <hi>Mahomet</hi> or not. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſuppoſing that we ſtand convict of the truth of Chriſtianity, by the ſame means we ſtand aſſured, that God hath cauſed thoſe great works to be done, by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, by our Lord and his Apoſtles, by which the world ſtands convict, that they were ſent by God, and by the ſame, that the Scriptures, wherein thoſe works and their doctrine is related, are from God. Neither can the Church act to the aſſuring of any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy herein as the Church, but as a multitude of men endowed with common ſenſe, which cannot agree to deceive or to be deceived. For if the profeſsion of Chriſtianity goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the being of the Church, and Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity cannot be received, till it be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, with the records thereof, to be from God, then this aſſurance, though it come from the agreement of the men that make the Church, goes in nature before the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a Church, and therefore comes as
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:115786:150"/> well from the conſent of Jews for the Old Teſtament, as of Chriſtians for the New. Nor let it trouble any man, that by this means, faith may ſeem to be the work of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, &amp; not the grace of God, ſeeing it may very reaſonably be demanded, Where is the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of grace, to enable a man to beleeve what he ſees reaſon to beleeve? For though the matter of faith be credible of it ſelf, yet it is not evident of it ſelf, &amp; though ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be ſhewed, why a man ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, yet on the other ſide, there are many ſcandals, and ſtumbling blocks in the way, to hinder him from beleeving, the chiefe of which is the offence of the Croſſe, whereof our Lord ſaith, <hi>Happy is he that is not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at me:</hi> For it cannot ſeem ſtrange, that a man ſhould refuſe to beleeve that which he ſees ſufficient reaſon to convince him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, when as, by beleeving, he becomes lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bear the Croſſe of Chriſt, ſpecially not being inforced by the light of reaſon, evidencing the truth of Chriſtianity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining the aſſent of the minde, as fire does wood to burn, but ſwaied by externall motives, working upon the minde, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they finde it diſpoſed to goodneſſe. For when this diſpoſition is not perfectly wrought by Gods grace, nothing hinders ſufficient motives to prove uneffectuall, to
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:115786:150"/> them whom the Croſſe of Chriſt ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth. This being reſolved, it follows by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence, upon what reaſons and by what means, the meaning of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, or rather the will of God concerning all matters queſtioned in Chriſtianity, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable. For it is not the ſame thing, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, to know the meaning of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, as it is to know how far it is Gods will that it binde the Church. The name of the Scripture inforceth no more, but that all is true which it containeth. Now it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth many times, the ſayings, and doings of evill men as well as of good, of Satan himſelf ſometimes, wherein, it intends onely to aſſure, that ſuch and ſuch things were ſaid and done. And, not to inſiſt on the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (which is all the word of God, and no part of it binding to us, as the Law of <hi>Moſes)</hi> becauſe another diſpoſition of Gods will may appear by other Scriptures, in the New Teſtament it ſelf, are found many things, that now have not the force of precepts, though it appear that they did ſometimes binde the Church: Such is the practice of the Feaſts of Love, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> preſſes ſo hard, as I ſhewed afore; ſuch is his precept that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men be vailed, men bare, when they pray in the Church; the decree of the Apoſtles at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> againſt eating blood, and things
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:115786:151"/> ſtrangled and ſacrificed to Idols; the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of S. <hi>James</hi> of anointing the ſick; the ceremonies of Baptiſm, which I ſhewed afore, out of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to have been in uſe in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church; yea, the very cuſtome of drenching in Baptiſm, which no man doubts but the inſtitution ſignifies, and yet is now ſcarce any where in uſe. If therefore, there be queſtion of the will of God, what is the true meaning of the Scriptures, and how far it bindes the Church, the ſame common ſenſe of all men, that aſſures the truth of the Scriptures, muſt aſſure it. The knowledge of originall languages, the compariſon of like paſſages, the conſideration of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and text of the Scripture, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of ancient Writers, deſcribing affairs of the ſame times, and if there be any other helps to underſtand the Scriptures by, they are but the means to improve common ſenſe, to convince or be convinced of it. If that will not ſerve to procure reſolution, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains nothing elſe but the conſent of the Church, teſtifying the beleef and practice of the firſt times that received the Scriptures, and thereby convincing common ſenſe of the meaning of them, as the intent of all Laws is evidenced, by the originall practice of the ſame. So that this whole queſtion, What Laws God hath given his Church, fals under
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:115786:151"/> the ſame reſolution, by which matters of faith were determined in the ancient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, in which, that which originally and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally had been received in the Church, that was ordained by them to be retained for the future, as demonſtrated to have been received from our Lord and his Apoſtles, by the ſame kinde of evidence, for which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſtianity, though not ſo copious, as of leſſe importance. And therefore it will not ſerve the turn to object, that the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of iniquity was a working even under the Apoſtles, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> II. 7. to cauſe the beleef and practice of the Primitive Church always to ſtand ſuſpect, as the means to bring in Antichriſt. For it is not enough to ſay, that Antichriſt was then a coming, unleſſe a man will undertake to ſpecifie, and prove by the Scriptures, that the being of Antichriſt conſiſts in that which he diſputes againſt. For if we will needs preſume, that the government of the Church which was received in the next age to the Apoſtles, is that wherein Antichriſtianiſm conſiſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the myſtery of iniquity was a work un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Apoſtles, why ſhall not the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians argue with as good right, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef of the Trinity and Incarnation, is that wherein Antichriſtianiſm conſiſts, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived likewiſe in the next age to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:115786:152"/> under whom the myſtery of iniquity was a work? Or rather, why is either the one or the other admitted, to argue, from ſuch obſcure Scriptures, things of ſuch dangerous conſequence, unleſſe they will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake further to prove by the Scriptures, that Antichriſt is Antichriſt for that which they cry down? Which I doe not ſee that they have endevoured to doe, for the things in queſtion among us, about the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church. Beſides this, my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon carries the anſwer to this objection in it, becauſe it challenges no authority, but that of hiſtoricall truth, to any record of the Church: Appealing for the reſt to common ſenſe to judge, whether that which is ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced to have been firſt in practice, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with that which is recorded in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, be not evidently the meaning of thoſe things, which we finde by the Scriptures, to have been inſtituted by our Lord and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. And this it is which for the preſent I have pretended to prove by this Diſcourſe: Which, being ſpent chiefly in removing the difficulty of thoſe Scriptures, which have been otherwiſe underſtood in this buſineſſe, confeſſeth the ſtrength of the cauſe to ſtand upon the originall, generall, and perpetuall practice of the Church, determining the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in difference by the ſame evidence, as
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:115786:152"/> Chriſtianity ſtands recommended to us, proportionably to the importance of them. Which, as it is not ſuch as is able to convince all judgements, which are not all capable to underſtand the ſtate of the whole Church, yet is it enough to maintain the poſſeſſion of right derived to this inſtant, ſo that no power on earth can undertake to erect Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call authority, without and againſt the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Apoſtles, upon the ground of a contrary perſwaſion, without incurring the crime of Schiſm.</p>
               <p>I will not leave this point, without ſaying ſomething of their caſe, that have Reformed the Church without authority of Biſhops, that have aboliſhed the Order, and veſted their Power (in which I have ſhewed that they ſucceed the Apoſtles, as to their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Churches, w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> dependence on the whol) upon Presbyteries, or whatſoever beſides. Which to decline here, might make men conceive, that I have a better or worſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them then indeed I have. For a Rule and modell, or Standard to meaſure what ought to be judged in ſuch a caſe, ſuppoſe we, (that which is poſſible in nature, the terms being conſiſtent together, though not at all likely to come to paſſe in the courſe of the world) a Chriſtian people, greater or leſſe, deſtitute of Paſtors endowed with the Chief
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:115786:153"/> authority left by the Apoſtles in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. I ſuppoſe, in this caſe, no man can doubt, but they are bound to admit the ſame courſe, as thoſe that are firſt converted to be Chriſtians: That is, to receive Paſtors from them that are able to found and erect Churches, and to unite them to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the whole Church, which is no leſſe authority, then that of a Synod of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, that onely, or the equivalent of it, in the perſon of an Apoſtle, or Commiſſary of an Apoſtle, being able to give a Chief Paſtor to any Church. But ſuppoſe further, that this authority cannot be had, ſhall we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that they ſhall be tied to live without Eccleſiaſticall communion? When it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that, as the Unity of the Church is part of the ſubſtance of the Chriſtian Faith, neceſſary to the ſalvation of all, ſo the firſt Divine Precept that thoſe Chriſtians ſhall be bound to, is, to live in the Society of a Church. For, where ſeverall things are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God, whereof the one is the means whereby the other is attained, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that the Chief Precept is that which commandeth the end, and that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth the means ſubordinate to the other. Now it is manifeſt, that all Powers, and all Offices endowed with the ſame in the Church, are Ordained by God, and enjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:115786:153"/> the Church, to the end that good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may be preſerved in the Church: And good Order is enjoined, as the means to preſerve Unity, and the Unity of the Church commanded, as the being of that Society, whereby Chriſtians are edified, both to the knowledge and exerciſe of Chriſtianity, by communicating with the Church, eſpecially, in the Service of God, and in thoſe Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances wherein he hath appointed it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. Seeing then this edification is the end for which the Society of the Church ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, and all Paſtors and Officers ordained, as means to procure it, as it is Sacrilege to ſeek the end without the means, when both are poſſible, ſo I conceive it would be Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, not to ſeek the end without the means, when both are not. Now it is manifeſtly poſſible, that the edification of the Church may be procured effectually, by thoſe that receive not their Power, or their Office, from perſons endowed with it themſelves afore: Eſpecially, if we ſuppoſe them to receive the ſame Power, to be exerciſed by the ſame Laws, which thoſe that received it from the Apoſtles themſelves, had, and acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, from the beginning. The conſequence of all this is plain enough. The reſolution of <hi>Gulielmus Antiſsiodorenſis</hi> among the Schoole Doctors, is well known and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:115786:154"/> That the Order of Biſhops, in caſe of neceſſity, may be propagated by Presbyters, ſuppoſing that they never received Power to do ſuch an Act, from them that had it. My reaſon makes me bold to reſolve further, that, in the caſe which is put, Chriſtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may appoint themſelves Biſhops, Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and Deacons, provided it be with ſuch limits of Power, to be exerciſed under ſuch Laws, as are appointed before, by our Lord and his Apoſtles: And, that upon theſe terms, they ought to be acknowledged by the reſt of the Church, whenſoever there is opportunity of communicating with the ſame, provided that they, and their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſubmit to ſuch further Laws, as the reſt of the Church hath provided, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regulating of it ſelf, according as the part is to ſubmit to the determination of the whole: And that this acknowledgement of them, would be effectuall, in ſtead of ſolemne Ordination, by Impoſition of Hands of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons endowed with that Power, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be conveyed by the ſame. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I make not perſonall ſucceſſion to be no Precept of God, (which if it were not, then no Schiſm were neceſſarily a Sin, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, all that can be ſaid of the Society of the Church, would be a Fable) but comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Order to another, of living in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:115786:154"/> of a Church, and therefore not bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when both are not poſſible, but the Chief is. Beſide this main reaſon included in my reſolution, drawn from the Rank of Precepts given by God, as theſe are, the ſame may be concluded by this conſequence: That whoſoever will conſider how many Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, inſtituted by the Apoſtles, have been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther totally aboliſhed, or very much chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, by the neceſsity of time, rendring them uſeleſſe to the ſucceeding condition of the Church, will not marvell to ſee their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity maintained, in the reſt of the Laws wherewith they have regulated the Church, without perpetuall ſucceſſion, where it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had, though otherwiſe not to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed without ſacrilege. How far this was the caſe of thoſe whom I ſpeak of, I will not undertake. It ſeems they could not have this authority propagated, by them that then had it, not conſenting to thoſe Apoſtolical Laws, which, as it is agreed among us, were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily to be reſtored in the Church. It ſeems alſo, that authority was not altogether wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the authors of ſuch reformations, being ſtill of ſome Order in the Church. For Presbyters, though they ſucceed not the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in the Chief authority eſtabliſhed by them in all Churches, yet their office was, from the beginning, to aſsiſt them in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:115786:155"/> of thoſe Churches whereof they were made Presbyters, not by way of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their commands onely, as Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, but by exerciſing the ſame power, where they could not diſcharge it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though with dependence on them in all matters not determined afore. Here was ſome degree of neceſſity, to bar the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Succeſſion of the Apoſtles. But no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity can be alleged, why they erected not Biſhops, Presbyters, and Deacons over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with ſuch limits of Power as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles from the beginning determined, ſeeing it is manifeſt, that the ſuperiority of them, was generally thought to come from the corruption of the Papacy, not from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Apoſtles: And therefore cannot be excuſed by neceſſity, becauſe they did not finde themſelves in neceſsity, but by their own falſe perſwaſion created it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Which notwithſtanding, ſeeing they profeſſe all that is neceſſary to the ſalvation of all Chriſtians, either in point of Faith or Manners, ſeeing, as to the publick Order of the Church, they intended, and deſired, and ſought to reſtore that, which, to their beſt underſtanding, came from the inſtitution of our Lord and his Apoſtles, they cannot eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be condemned, to have forfeited the being of a Church, out of which, there is no ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:115786:155"/> by this or other miſtakes of like conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, of them that conſider the abuſes from whence they departed. For the Church is neceſſarily a Humane, though no Civile Society, which we are commanded by God, in the firſt place, to entertain: And, as there is no Society of men, wherein a particular member can prevail, to ſettle ſuch Laws, and ſuch Order, as are propereſt to the end of it, ſo muſt he live and die out of Communion with the Church, that ſtaies, till he finde a Church, that maintains all that was inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our Lord and his Apoſtles. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though that which they have done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Apoſtles order cannot be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet there is a reaſonable preſumption, that God excuſes it, being no part of that which he hath commanded all to beleeve to ſalvation, or which he hath commanded par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men to doe: Becauſe the publick or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Church is commanded particular perſons, as members of the Church, which cannot be done, without conſent of the whole, that is, of them that are able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it. But if any Secular Power upon earth, ſhall preſume to erect this Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Power, by taking it away from them that lawfully have it, (that is, by an Act of thoſe that have the Power before, done by virtue of ſome Humane Law, which Act the Law
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:115786:156"/> of God doth not make void) and giving it to thoſe, that have it not by any ſuch Act; And that, upon another ground then that which hath been ſpecified, of bringing back into force and uſe, ſuch Laws of our Lord and his Apoſtles, as have by neglect of time been aboliſhed and brought out of uſe, this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whatſoever it is, ſhall not fail, in ſo doing, to incurre the Crime of Schiſm, and all that concurre or conſent to the bringing of ſuch an Act into effect, ſhall neceſſarily incurre the ſame. Much more, if it be done with a further intent, by the means of perſons thus inveſted with Eccleſiaſticall Power, to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Laws contrary to the inſtitution of our Lord and his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>But, though it is poſsible to imagine a caſe, in which the conſent of Chriſtians may erect an Eccleſiaſticall authority over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by means whereof they may live in the Society of a Church, yet there is no manner of caſe imaginable, in which any people, or any power but the Soveraign, can eſtabliſh or maintain the exerciſe of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in any thing which they conceive never ſo neceſſary to Chriſtianity, by the power of the Sword, which is the force of the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lararm. The reaſon is peremptory, becauſe the profeſsion of Chriſt his Croſſe, is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to Chriſtianity, or rather the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:115786:156"/> and marrow of it. For, if it were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for any perſons whatſoever, to defend themſelves by force, upon no other title, but for the maintenance of themſelves, in the exerciſe of their Chriſtianity, then muſt it needs follow, that, by virtue of their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, they may lawfully uſe all Soveraign power, by which force and the ſword is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: Contrary to the principle premiſed at the beginning, that no good, no right of this world, accrues to any man by virtue of his Chriſtianity, or decrues from another for want of it: As the power of the Sword, which is uſed by Title of Chriſtianity, is neceſſarily taken from him who otherwiſe is poſſeſſed of it, by them which defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the ſame, upon the Title of Chriſtianity; And by conſequence, all goods, all rights, all eſtates and qualities of this World, that accrue unto any man, by the uſe and ſucceſſe of ſuch Arms, are neceſſarily held and poſſeſſed by no Title, but that of Chriſtianity. For, they that have right to defend themſelves, cannot be ſubject to the Croſſe, whenſoever they are able to defend themſelves, ſeeing they may as well impoſe it upon their enemies, if they have ſucceſſe, as bear it themſelves, if they have not; Though neither is it Chriſts Croſſe, which a man bears for want of ſucceſſe. And if this had
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:115786:157"/> not been the profeſsion of the Primitive Chriſtians, how could they have defended themſelves by reaſon, and maintain, that the Gentile Powers ought not to perſecute them? Seeing that all Powers are bound to maintain themſelves, becauſe therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the maintenance of the world in peace. So unreaſonable is it which hath been ſaid, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> underſtood not himſelf, when he affirmeth, that the Chriſtians were then able to defend themſelves againſt perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were it not contrary to their profeſſion ſo to doe. For, as no man of common ſenſe would tell the Romanes, that the Chriſtians were able to reſiſt them, if they were not, becauſe they knew well enough how able they were: So no man zealous of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, would think to advantage it, by ſuch commendations, as the enemies of it might diſcover to be falſe. And therefore, if we reaſon not amiſſe, this is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſtianity and Mahumetiſm. For <hi>Mahomet</hi> alſo pretended to be perſecuted for religion by the Gentiles of <hi>Arabia,</hi> witneſſe the computation of their years, from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, or Perſecution, or flight of <hi>Mahomet</hi> from <hi>Mecca:</hi> But when we ſee that he took up arms thereupon, and begun an order which all his Succeſſors have obſerved, to propagate their Religion by the ſame means,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:115786:157"/> we ſee by this means, the difference between Chriſtianity and Mahumetiſm. And it is to be conſidered, by them that bring Jews again into Chriſtian States, how they will ſecure thoſe States, againſt this danger from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm. For, ſince they have made it part of their profeſſion, to expect a Meſsias, that ſhall conquer the Nations, and reſtore them to the Land of Promiſe: upon appearance that ſuch a Meſsias is come, they are not like to reſt, if they can hope to be his followers, as they reſted not under <hi>Adriane,</hi> and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times, when they have diſturbed the peace of the States under which they lived, upon the like hope. This alſo, if we reaſon not amiſſe, is the juſteſt title of all the wars, that Chriſtians have made upon the Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans, for the holy Land, becauſe the title upon which the Mahumetans firſt ſubdued it, makes them enemies to all civile Nations, that are Chriſtian, ſeeing that the title of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is as good againſt all, as againſt any, and whatſoever perſon or people uſurpeth Soveraign Power upon it, proclaimeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by defiance to all States, which he ſhall be able to deal with. And therefore this is not the caſe of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under <hi>Moſes:</hi> The Title whereupon they challenged the Land of Promiſe from the Nations preſently in poſſeſsion, being the deed of Gods Gift,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:115786:158"/> and the conſideration and condition upon which God granted it, their undertaking his Law. For, though it is true, that they clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Land of Promiſe upon Covenant with God, to be ruled by his Laws, in which their Religion is contained, and though this deed of Gods gift, could not be evident by naturall reaſon to other Nations, yet, ſeeing they profeſſed themſelves conſtituted onely Gods Commiſſaries, to puniſh the ſins of the ſeven Nations, and to root them out for their Idolatries, not to impoſe their Religion upon any other Nations, or to ſeek any inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe out of the Land of Promiſe, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that by this profeſsion, they did not give other Nations juſt cauſe to reſiſt them by force, neither had they any right to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, in their pretended conqueſt of the Land of Promiſe. And therefore the Kings of the <hi>Amorites</hi> beyond <hi>Jordan, Sihon</hi> and <hi>Og,</hi> hindring them by force to accompliſh and execute this Commiſsion of God, we ſee they received an acceſſory command to ſubdue them by force, and deſtroy them; and thereupon, an acceſſory grant of their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, for an addition to their inheritance. So, my intent hereby is not to ſay, that God may not diſpoſe of the goods of this world, to thoſe that enter into Covenant of religion with him, as the condition of the ſame: Or,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:115786:158"/> that man may not lawfully make uſe of ſuch a diſpoſition of his, made known by that Revelation, which is unknown to thoſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom it is granted: (for I avow that he did ſo to the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and that they lawfully did ſo againſt the ſeven Nations) But that he did it not by the New Covenant of Chriſtianity, becauſe it invites the Soveraign Powers of all Nations, upon condition to enjoy the ſame Rights, which they ſtand poſſeſt of when they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it. And, that he did not, by any Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, afterwards, make the like grant to Mahomet, as a privilege of the Religion which he pretendeth to have received from God, becauſe, if Chriſtianity be true, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religion muſt ſucceed it. Whereupon it follows, that thoſe Chriſtians, that ſhall take upon them to bear Armes, and make War, upon the Title of Chriſtianity, doe make themſelves thereby, enemies to all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Nations that are Chriſtian, as Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans are: Becauſe, as we know that Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metiſm is not from God, ſo we know, that Chriſtianity enables no man to uſe the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Sword, wherein Soveraignty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts; And that if any might maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Religion by the Title of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, then all that might come to have the ſame opinion, might doe the like, and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:115786:159"/> ſo, all States might be troubled, by fighting for Chriſtianity, within themſelves, though not ſubdued, as by Mahumetans, ſeeking to impoſe their Religion upon others.</p>
               <p>Againſt this place, there is onely one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of moment, ſo far as I can imagine, out of the Scriptures, and that is from the example of the <hi>Maccabees.</hi> For, on the one ſide, it is manifeſt, that the arms which they took up againſt <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> their lawfull Soveraign, are approved by God, not onely as foretold by <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and other Prophets, that by them God would give his people freedome, and rule of the Land of Promiſe, but alſo, becauſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle manifeſtly commendeth their faith, when he reckoneth their ſufferings among thoſe great effects which it brought forth, <hi>Heb.</hi> XI. 35, 36. And upon this account it is, that, in propounding this objection, I ſaid, that it is taken out of the Scriptures, not meaning thereby the Books of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> but thoſe Scriptures, which, by conſequence, ſeem to approve of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> proceedings. For, on the other ſide, it is manifeſt, that they juſtified their arms upon title of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by the firſt breaking out of it, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> II. 24, 26, 27. where the zeal of the Law, and the example of <hi>Phinehas,</hi> is expreſſed to be that, which moved <hi>Mattathias</hi> to kill the
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:115786:159"/> Jew whom he ſaw ſacrificing to Idols, and to maintain it by arms. Whereby it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that, out of zeal to the Law, they took arms to defend it, leſt it ſhould be extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the Tyranny of <hi>Antiochus;</hi> and therefore, that, when their arms took effect, and purchaſed them freedome, and the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty to the race of <hi>Mattathias,</hi> all this they held by Religion, and by no other title. And, for this reaſon it is, that they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Maccabees,</hi> though other extravagant reaſons have been imagined by men of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent learning. For, it is to be obſerved, that all thoſe that ſuffered, as well as fought in this cauſe, are called <hi>Maccabees,</hi> no leſſe then <hi>Judas Maccabaeus,</hi> and therefore, the hiſtories of their acts are called <hi>the Books of the Maccabees,</hi> in which is compriſed as well the ſtory of the Mother &amp; the ſeven children, and others that ſuffered for the Law, as the acts of <hi>Judas</hi> and his Succeſſors: And, <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> his Book, in praiſe of that Mother and her children, is entitled, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: The reaſon of which is found in the Syriack, in which language <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifieth Zelotes, as you have it in <hi>Ferrarius</hi> his <hi>Nomenclator Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riacus.</hi> And that this was the Title of their arms, is more manifeſt by the caſe of the Jews under <hi>Caligula,</hi> when, out of his mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he commanded to ſet up his ſtatue in
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:115786:160"/> the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> For as, by <hi>Philo de Legatione ad Caium,</hi> we underſtand, that they were willing to undergo any thing, and continue in obedience, ſo they might enjoy their Religion: So <hi>Joſephus</hi> diſſembleth not, in the relation of that buſineſs, <hi>Antiq.</hi> XVIII. 11. that they would have taken arms, rather then endure it, if <hi>Caligula</hi> had not been ſlain in the mean time. The clearing of this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is to be fetched from the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Law and the Goſpel, expreſſed in the words of our Lord to his Diſciples, that required him to call for fire from heaven, upon thoſe that would not entertain him, <hi>Luke</hi> IX. 55, 56. <hi>Ye know not of what ſpirit ye are: For the Son of man is not ſent to deſtroy mens ſouls,</hi> that is, their lives, <hi>but to ſave them.</hi> For <hi>the Law worketh wrath;</hi> and, <hi>where there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſsion;</hi> and, <hi>by Law is the knowledge of ſin,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> IV. 20. V. 15. VII. 7. Therefore, the Law ſuffered him that was next of kin to any man that was ſlain, to kill him that ſlew him, before it was judged, whether he was ſlain by chance, or by malice, <hi>Num.</hi> XXXV. 16—Therefore, the Law commanded him that was tempted to Idolatry, to ſeek the death of him that tempted him, were he his father, or never ſo near of kin, <hi>Deut.</hi> XIII. 6,—11. In fine, the Law being the condition of a
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:115786:160"/> temporall eſtate, aſſigned at firſt by God to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> obſerving it, can there be any marvell, that it might be lawfull for that people, to defend it by force, and by that defenſe to regain the ſame eſtate? Or will this draw any conſequence in Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to make it lawfull to take arms upon the title thereof, and ſo to hold eſtates of this world, by the ſame title, in caſe thoſe arms take effect? For, the Goſpel is the condition of life everlaſting, promiſed to thoſe that embrace it, including the Croſſe of Chriſt, and therefore, renouncing all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of this world, and, equally belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to all people, and therefore maintaining all, in the ſame eſtate of this world which it finds. Therefore, the zeal of <hi>Elias,</hi> when he puniſhed with fire from heaven, thoſe that attempted to ſeize him at the unjuſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of an Idolatrous King, our Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, not to ſute with the Spirit of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, (the profeſſion thereof being to take up Chriſts Croſſe, and to bear it with patience) though under the Law it might be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. Whereunto agreeth that which I ſaid before, that Hereſie and Schiſm, upon cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, onely contrary to Chriſtianity, and, that are not againſt the Law of Nature and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are no capitall crimes in Chriſtian States: And that, in ſtead of death, which
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:115786:161"/> the Law inflicteth upon him that obeyeth not the Conſiſtory, but cauſeth Schiſm, the puniſhment allotted by the Goſpel is, onely to bee leaſt in the kingdome of Heaven. For, if Soveraign Powers lawfully eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, being Chriſtian, are not enabled by their Chriſtianity, to inflict death, on the ſaid crimes, when, ſetting aſide Chriſtianity, they are not liable to it, much leſſe is any man under a Soveraign Power, enabled by his Chriſtianity, to uſe the Sword, wherein Soveraignty conſiſts, for the maintenance of it. Neither is it contrary to this, that, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, S. <hi>Peter</hi> puniſhes <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> with death, and the Apoſtles, as I ſhewed before, were endowed with a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous power of inflicting bodily puniſhment upon thoſe which obeyed them not, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects whereof were ſeen upon thoſe whom they caſt out of the Church, as alſo upon <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lymas,</hi> ſtruck with blindneſſe by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> for reſiſting his Goſpel: Nor, that the ſouls under the Altar, <hi>Apoc.</hi> VI. 10. pray for the vengeance of their bloud, to be ſhewed upon the inhabitants of the earth. For, that which this Propheticall Viſion repreſenteth, is to be underſtood, ſutably to Chriſtianity, and to the Kingdome of God attained by it. Since, therefore, revenge is contrary to the principles of Chriſtianity, we cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:115786:161"/> that bleſſed ſouls deſire it, but the cry which they make, muſt be underſtood to be, the provocation of God to vengeance, which their ſufferings produce: So much more pertinently attributed to bleſſed ſouls, in as much as, being acquainted with Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, they approve and rejoyce in his Juſtice, and the advancement of his Church by the means of it. Now the power granted the Apoſtles, of inflicting bodily puniſhments, upon thoſe that diſobeyed them, tended firſt, to manifeſt that God was preſent in the Church, and, by conſequence, to ſubdue the world to Chriſtianity, and to win authority to the Church and the cenſures of it: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Elias,</hi> when he called for fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as the Apoſtles deſired our Lord, might have been ſecured himſelf, by the like mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, without deſtroying his enemies: So he cauſed <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts to be put to death, not to vindicate the cauſe in debate, which was already done by a miracle, but to doe ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on them as malefactors: And ſo <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeus</hi> curſeth the children to death, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to puniſh the affront offered his perſon: In all which particulars, you have manifeſt characters of the Law, inflicting death for the puniſhment of ſin, whereas, under the Goſpel, which giveth life, the inflicting of bodily puniſhment ſerveth to procure the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:115786:162"/> good of the world, by manifeſting the truth of the Goſpel, and the preſence of God in his Church, which was known and ſuppoſed under the Law, becauſe thoſe who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Law, could not make any queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that God was amongſt his people, and ſpoke to them by his Prophets.</p>
               <p>When I ſay, that it might be lawfull to take arms upon the title of Religion under the Law, I ſay not that it was ſo in all caſes, or that it was not lawfull for the Jews to be ſubject to forein Powers, (which was the doctrine of <hi>Judas</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> complained of by <hi>Joſephus)</hi> but, that it was poſſible for ſome caſe to fall out, wherein it might be lawfull. As for the conceit of <hi>Judas</hi> of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,</hi> it is manifeſtly taken away by Gods command to the Jews under <hi>Nabuchodoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, Jer.</hi> XXIX. 7. <hi>Seek the peace of the City to which I have ſent you Captives, for in the peace thereof you ſhall have peace.</hi> And it is moſt remarkable, that our Lord, being falſly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of this doctrine to <hi>Pilate,</hi> by the Jews, it pleaſed God to ſuffer it ſo far to prevail af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, that the arms which they took af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards againſt the Romanes, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries which they endured by the Zelotes, and finally, the ruine of the City, Temple, and Nation, muſt needs be imputed to this doctrine, which they falſly accuſed our Lord
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:115786:162"/> of, to gain the good will of the Romanes. But of Chriſtianity, it muſt be ſaid on the contrary, that there is no caſe poſſible, wherein it can be juſt to take arms for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or reformation of it, upon the title thereof, that is to ſay, where there is not a Power of bearing arms, eſtabliſhed by ſome other title of humane right. For where there is any ſuch Power and Right eſtabliſhed, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a title which the Law of Nations juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it is not to be ſaid, that Chriſtianity voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth or extinguiſheth the ſame, ſeeing it hath been ſaid, that it preſerveth the ſtate of this world, upon the ſame terms, in which they are, when it is imbraced: But nevertheleſſe it moderateth the uſe of it, ſo that it cannot, with Chriſtianity, be imploied in very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny caſes, in which the Law of Nature and Nations juſtifies the uſe of it.</p>
               <p>Theſe things thus premiſed, it will be eaſie to ſhew, that the Presbyterians offer wrong, when they demand, that the ſuperiority of Biſhops over Presbyters be proved to be of Divine Right, by ſome Precept of Gods Law, recorded in the Scriptures: Suppoſing that, otherwiſe, it will be in the Secular Power, of it ſelf to erect an Eccleſiaſticall Power, by taking it from them that have it, and giving it to them that have it not, and requiring, that ſo it be done. For, it is notorious to the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:115786:163"/> world, that, from the beginning they claimed that Presbyteries ſhould be erected in ſtead of the Government of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> upon this ground, that the Presbyteries are commanded by God, and that therefore the ſuperiority of Biſhops, as contrary to his Law, is to be aboliſhed: And that upon this pretenſe, the people were drawn in to ſeek the innovation endevoured at this time. So that, to require now that it be proved, that the ſuperiority of Biſhops is commanded by God to be unchangeable by men, otherwiſe, that it be changed, is to require that the concluſion may ſtand, without any premiſes to prove it. Notwithſtanding, to paſſe by this advantage, ſuppoſe we the ſuperiority of Biſhops neither forbidden nor comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but introduced by Eccleſiaſticall Right, grounded upon the Power given the Church, of giving Laws to the Church, by determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that which Gods Law determineth not: Suppoſing, but not granting this to be true, it will remain nevertheleſſe without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of any Secular Power upon earth, to erect this Eccleſiaſticall Power, by taking it from them which have it, and giving it to them which have it not. For, whereſoever there is a Church, and the Government thereof not contrary to Gods Law, in thoſe hands which have it by mans, there the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:115786:163"/> precept of obeying the Governors of the Church; 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> V. 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> XIII. 17. muſt needs oblige the People to thoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors that are eſtabliſhed not againſt Gods Law. And this Precept of the Apoſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Divine Right by which Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſubſiſteth, cannot be voided by any Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Power, by which the Church ſubſiſteth not, in point of Right, but onely is maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in point of fact. For, the obligation which they have to the Church, and the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity thereof, and the Order by which that Unity is preſerved, and the Government in which that Order conſiſteth, being more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient then the maintenance of Chriſtianity by the State, cannot be taken away by any obligation or intereſſe thereupon ariſing: And therefore, as the firſt Chriſtians that were under Chriſtian Powers, in the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> were bound to adhere to the Paſtors which they had by the Law of the Church (for which reaſon neither did <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine, Conſtantius,</hi> or <hi>Valens,</hi> ever ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to intrude thoſe Biſhops, which they were ſeduced to think neceſſary for the quiet of ſome Churches, being indeed dangerous to Chriſtianity, by their own Power, but by a pretended legall Act of the Church) after <hi>Conſtantine</hi> took Chriſtianity into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Empire, upon the ſame terms
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:115786:164"/> as afore: So are all Chriſtians to the worlds end obliged, to adhere to the Paſtors which they ſhall have by the Law of the Church, not contrary to Gods Law, againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of any Secular Power to obey others. And to demand that Eccleſiaſticall Power not contrary to Gods Law, be diſſolved by Secular, to which the perſons endowed therewith are Subjects, is to demand that there remain no Chriſtians in <hi>England,</hi> that can be content to ſuffer for their Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by obeying Gods Law before mans, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they can obey both, acting by Gods, and ſuffering by mans. But, though I inſiſt upon this right of the Church, yet it is not my purpoſe to balk the fruit of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right of Biſhops, upon ſuch terms as it hath been aſſerted: That is to ſay, as that which no man may lawfully deſtroy, though not as that which, being deſtroied, voideth the being of a Church, (if it can be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Schiſm) becauſe not commanded par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Chriſtians, as the ſubſtance of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, but the Society of the Church, for the maintenance and ſupport of it. For, if no Secular Power be able to give that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the Presbyteries, which muſt be taken from the Biſhops, ſuppoſing that the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of Biſhops ſtands neither by, nor againſt the Law of God, but onely by the Law of
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:115786:164"/> the Church, according to Gods: How much more, when it is demonſtrated, that it ſubſiſteth by the Act of the Apoſtles, ſhall it be without the compaſſe of any Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Power to diſſolve it? And therefore, the conſequence hereof, in the preſent ſtate of Chriſtianity among us, is further to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, becauſe many men may be perſwaded of their obligation to the Church, upon ſuppoſition of the Divine Right of Biſhops, who perhaps perceive not the former rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their obligation to them here aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as to the Ordinary Paſtors of the Church.</p>
               <p>To proceed then, out of the premiſes, to frame a judgement of the ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſtianity in <hi>England</hi> at the preſent, and from that judgement to conclude, what, they that will preſerve the conſcience of good Chriſtians, are to doe or to avoid, in maintaining the Society and Communion of the Church: Put the caſe, that an Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Power be claimed and uſed, upon ſome perſwaſions contrary to the ſubſtance of true Chriſtianity, and pretending, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to govern thoſe that adhere to the ſame perſwaſion, in the Communion of thoſe Ordinances, which God requireth to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with, by his Church, according to the ſame perſwaſion: I ſuppoſe, no man will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:115786:165"/> this to be the crime of Hereſie, containing not onely a perſwaſion contrary to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Faith, but alſo an Eccleſiaſticall Power founded upon it, and thereby a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Communion of the Church, which acknowledgeth not the ſame. Put the caſe again, that an Eccleſiaſticall Power is claimed and uſed, not upon a perſwaſion contrary to any thing immediately neceſſary to the ſalvation of all Chriſtians, (as, the foundation of Faith, and all that belongeth to it, is) but upon a perſwaſion contrary to ſomething neceſſary to the Society of the whole Church, as commanded by our Lord Chriſt or his Apoſtles to be regulated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; and this, with a pretenſe to govern thoſe that adhere to the ſame perſwaſion, in the Communion of all Eccleſiaſticall Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, according to it, this I cannot ſee how it can be denied to be the crime of Schiſm. And this, God be bleſſed that I cannot ſay it is done in <hi>England,</hi> but, in conſequence to the premiſes, I muſt ſay, that this is it which hath been, and is endevoured to be done in it, and therefore to be avoided by all that will not communicate in an act of Schiſm. I doe not deny that Presbyters have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſe in the Power of the Keys, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, in all parts of Eccleſiaſticall Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, being all the productions thereof: But
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:115786:165"/> I have ſhewed, that their Intereſſe is in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon their reſpective Biſhops, without whom, by the Ordinance of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and the practice of all Churches, that are not parties in this cauſe, nothing is to be done. When as therefore Presbyters, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding among themſelves the eminent Power of their Biſhops, preſume to manage it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out acknowledgement of them, out of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that the eminence of their Power is contrary to the Ordinance of our Lord and his Apoſtles, or, that, not being contrary to the ſame, it is lawfull for Presbyters, to take it out of the hands, either of Biſhops or of ſimple Presbyters, had they been ſo poſſeſſed of it. When as they joyn with themſelves ſome of the People, in the quality of Lay Elders, or what ever they will have them called, and of theſe conſtitute Conſiſtories for all ſeverall Congregations, endowed with the Power of the Keys over the ſame, though in dependence upon greater Aſſemblies, out of the opinion that this is the Ordinance of our Lord &amp; his Apoſtles, and this, not to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the Intereſſe of the People, that nothing paſſe contrary to the Laws given the Church by God, which are their inheritance as well as the Clergies, but, in a number double to that of the Presbyters in all Conſiſtories, and in a right equall to them, man for man; ſo
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:115786:166"/> that it may truly be ſaid, that the whole Power of Clergy and People, is veſted in theſe Lay Elders, that one quality conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, being able to conclude the whole: When as the determination, who ſhall or ſhall not be admitted to Communion, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth at laſt to a number of Secular perſons, making them thereby Judges of the Laws of Chriſtianity, and enabling them thereby, to give and take away the Eccleſiaſticall being of any member of the Church, in thoſe caſes, to which that power extendeth, and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting a Civile Court with the Power of the Keys in the ſame: (All theſe points being members of the Ordinance for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Presbyteries.) I ſay then, that, by that Ordinance, an Eccleſiaſticall Power is erected, upon ſo many perſwaſions, of things concerning the publick Order of the Society of the Church, contrary to the Laws given the Church by our Lord and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, by a Secular Power, intereſſed onely in point of Fact, in Church matters, without any ground of Right to do it; and that, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the endevouring to eſtabliſh theſe Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries is an act of Schiſm, which particular Chriſtians, though they never, by any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe act of their own, tied themſelves to be ſubject to Biſhops, are nevertheleſſe bound not to communicate in, becauſe they are
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:115786:166"/> bound upon their ſalvation to maintain the Unity of the Church, and the Unity of the Church, eſtabliſhed upon theſe Laws, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Succeſſion of Biſhops is one. As for the deſign of the Congregations, it is eaſily perceived to come to this effect: That, to the intent that Chriſtian people may be tied to no Laws, but ſuch as the Spirit of God which is in them, convinces them to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon the Church by the Scripture, and that thereupon, the ordering of all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning the Society of the Church, may proceed upon conviction of every mans judgement: Therefore, every Congregation of Chriſtians, aſſembling to the Service of God, to be abſolute and independent on any other part, or the whole Church, the Power being veſted in the members of the ſaid Congregation, under the Authority of the Paſtor and Elders, as aforeſaid. And, that therefore, every Congregation conſtituting it ſelf a Church, conſtitutes by conſequence, and deſtitutes Paſtors, Elders, and Members: So that, by this deſign, an Eccleſiaſticall Power being erected upon ſo many perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, contrary to the Laws given the Church by our Lord and his Apoſtles, the act of Schiſm is more viſible. Though, for the claim and Title, by which this Eccleſiaſticall Power is erected in both ways, that of the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:115786:167"/> Congregations is more ſutable to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, (becauſe that of the Presbyteries more forcible) both equally deſtructive to the right of the Church: For, that a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which Power the Aſſembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines was called, (not diſputing now the Power of a Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it to be as great for the purpoſe, as any Chriſtian State can exerciſe) ſhould erect an Eccleſiaſticall Power, by taking it from thoſe that have it, and giving it to thoſe that have it not, is without the Sphere of any Power, which ſtands not by the Conſtitution of the Church. For, if the Church ſubſiſted before any Secular Power was Chriſtian, by a Power veſted by our Lord in his Apoſtles, extending it in one viſible Society, beyond the bounds of any Dominion, with equall intereſſe in the parts of it through ſeverall Dominions, what title, but force, can any State have to doe it, if we preſuppoſe the Society of the Church, as ſuch, unable to doe it? Therefore, by the Society of the Church, and by Chriſtians as Members thereof, it muſt be done, whatſoever is done, either in Reforming the Church, or in Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from the Church. And therefore the proceeding of the Congregations, when they ſeparate from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by a Right founded upon the Conſtitution
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:115786:167"/> of the Church, is more agreeable to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, then the proceeding of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries, when they pretend to Reform the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by the Power of the Parliament, ſuppoſing it to be as great as any Secular Power can be in Church mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But I intend not hereby to grant that it is a rightfull Title, upon which thoſe of the Congregations ſeparate from the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For as men cannot make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians, but the doing of it muſt preſuppoſe a Church, as at the firſt it preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Power of conſtituting a Church, eſtated by our Lord upon his Apoſtles: (Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Lord hath required of thoſe that will be ſaved, not onely to beleeve his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, but alſo to profeſſe Chriſtianity, and this Profeſſion to be conſigned in the hands of thoſe, whom he truſteth with the conduct of his Church, and by them accepted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if not ſincere and complete, it is not to be admitted) ſo, the continuance in the Communion of the Church, preſuppoſing an acknowledgement of the Chriſtianity profeſſed therein, to contain nothing deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to ſalvation, profeſſeth an obligation of acknowledging the Governours thereof, in order to the ſame. And this obligation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable, by the premiſes, unleſſe Chriſtian people, by thoſe Governours, appear to be
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:115786:168"/> defeated of the benefit of ſuch Laws, given the Church by our Lord and his Apoſtles, as appear to be of greater conſequence to the Service of God, for which the Society of the Church ſubſiſts, then the perſonall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Governours, and the Unity of the Church, wherein it conſiſteth, can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to be. Which in our preſent caſe is ſo far from being true, that the premiſes being true, all the particulars, for which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations ſeparate, and which the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries would Reform, the Chief Power of the Clergy over the People, the Superiority of Biſhops above Presbyters, the dependence of Congregations upon the City Church, the Power of giving Laws to the Church, the Right of Firſt-fruits, Tithes, and all Conſecrate things, and above all the Unity of the Church, and the Perſonall Succeſſion of Governours in which it conſiſteth, are all demonſtrated to have been ordained by the Apoſtles. The ſame is to be ſaid of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, as to the whole kinde, though not to the particulars queſtioned. For firſt, it is proved, that the Rule of Charity requires all Chriſtians, to forbear the uſe of that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which Chriſtianity alloweth, in all things determined by the Law of the Church, not contrary to Gods. Secondly, though it be granted, that the particulars
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:115786:168"/> queſtioned were not inſtituted by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, (for indeed, the cuſtomes of ſeverall Nations, that have received Chriſtianity, are ſo different, that, for example, that which the Apoſtle commandeth, <hi>that men pray co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XI. 3. cannot be uſed among thoſe Nations, that uncover the head, in ſign of reverence, which the Ancients did not: And this is the true reaſon, why the ſame Ceremonies of Divine Service, are not in uſe now, as under the Apoſtles) yet whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall ſeparate from the Church upon this ground, that ſignificative Ceremonies are not to be uſed in the Service of God, ſhall doe it to eſtabliſh a Law contrary to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, who ordained ſuch to be uſed, as I ſhewed afore. Beſides, the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and Governours thereof, doe not maintain any infallible Power of conducting the Church, profeſſing themſelves the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation which their Predeceſſors made, and therefore, are ſo far from refuſing any Law of God to be a Law of this Church, that if any Humane Conſtitution had been recommended to them, (evidently neceſſary or uſefull, to make the Laws of our Lord and his Apoſtles effectuall to this particular Church) by ſuch an authority as the Secular Power hath over them, it is viſible to all Engliſh, that, for the Peace of the Church
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:115786:169"/> and themſelves, they would not have refuſed it. And therefore, the true reaſon of this Separation, or Reformation is, becauſe they will not part with that Power, which is in them derived from the Apoſtles, and at once with the Unity of the Church, neceſſarily, in this Caſe, depending on the ſame.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe what will be anſwered, that all this is done to Reform the Church, to bring in plentifull and powerfull Preaching, and Praying as the Spirit ſhall indite; for, not knowing any thing elſe to be pretended, and having ſhewed the reſt of the change to be contrary to the Ordinances of the Apoſtles, though I ſee no man is ſo hard hearted; as not to think his own deſign to be the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Church, without ever proving it to be ſo, yet I muſt needs think it part of my charge, to ſay ſomewhat alſo to this. I doe acknowledge, then, a charge upon the Church, to provide, that Chriſtians, made members of the Church by Baptiſme, be taught more and more in the true intent of their Chriſtianity, and exhorted to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it, by virtue of the Precept of our Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> XXVIII. 19, 20. <hi>Goe Preach, and make Diſciples all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt: Teaching them to obſerve all that I have commanded you:</hi> Which, being given
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:115786:169"/> the Apoſtles, is, by the ſame reaſon, given to all whom they ſhould aſſume, or Ordain, or cauſe to be Ordained, to exerciſe their Power, or any part of it, in dependence upon the ſame, and according as the ſame ſhould determine in time or place. But, that any thing is determined, as of Divine Right, or by the Scriptures, when, where, how often, how ſeldome, in what manner, and how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Preaching is, by the Church, to be furniſhed to the Church, he will make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ridiculous that undertakes to affirm. That the Church is to endevour, that this Office be as frequent, as may be to the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Church, appears indeed by the Scriptures: Not thoſe which ſpeak of <hi>publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the Goſpell,</hi> under the terms of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or any equivalent, as <hi>Rom.</hi> X. 14-1 <hi>Tim.</hi> IV. 2, 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> IX. 16. But thoſe that expreſſe the diligence of the Apoſtles, and Apoſtolicall perſons of their time, in teaching the Aſſemblies of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>Acts</hi> II. 42, 46. V. 42. VI. 2, 4. XI. 26. and the frequenting of this Office in thoſe times, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XIV. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> V. 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> XII. 6. 7. But, that it ſhould be ſo eaſie for them, that now are admitted to the Service of the Church, to Preach continually, ſo as to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Church by their Preaching, as it was for Apoſtles, Apoſtolicall perſons, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:115786:170"/> is not for a reaſonable man to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. And thoſe that ſtand ſo much upon Preaching twice every Lords Day, would finde themſelves at a marvellous exigent, if they ſhould prove, either the neceſſity of it, in point of Right, by the Scriptures, or the utility of it, in point of Fact, by the abilities of the men whom themſelves ſet about it. As for Prayer, I yeeld that it is a Precept of God, that the Prayers of Chriſtian Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations be preſented to God by the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: But what Prayers? none but thoſe which the Euchariſt was celebrated with, of which I ſpoke afore. All the world will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhew any title in the Scriptures, or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall practice of the Church, to prove, that the Apoſtles ordained theſe prayers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after the Sermons of Presbyters, which are now made the greateſt part of the exerciſe of Chriſtianity, unleſſe it be becauſe the Sermon went before the Euchariſt, as <hi>Acts</hi> XX. 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XIV. 16. The Prayers which the Presbyters offer to God in behalf of the Church, being, by the inſtitution of the Apoſtles, onely thoſe which the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt is celebrated with. I acknowledge, that, under the Apoſtles, the Prayers of the Church were not preſcribed, but conceived by thoſe that were emploied in that office by the Church; But, in conſideration of the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:115786:170"/> Propheticall Revelations, and immediate inſpirations, which, the perſons emploied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that Office, were then graced with, to ſhew the truth of Chriſtianity, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God in the Church. And therefore, ſince thoſe graces ceaſed, I have ſhewed, in the Apoſtolicall Form of Divine Service, <hi>p.</hi> 348. that thoſe Prayers of the Church which went not with the Euchariſt, were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by Deacons, becauſe it was found neceſſary, that both the one and the other ſhould be done in a preſcript form, to avoid the ſcandals of Chriſtianity, that we ſee come, by referring it to all perſons, that are truſted to officiate publick ſervice. And I am aſtoniſhed, that any Chriſtian ſhould imagine, that God ſhould be pleaſed with the conceptions of the minde, or expreſſions of the tongue (ſetting aſide the affection of the heart) that any man prays with. But now, by the pretenſe on foot, which makes the exerciſe of Chriſtianity to conſiſt in a Sermon, and a Prayer conceived before or after it, not onely the celebration of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, which the Apoſtles ordained to be as frequent as the Prayers of the Presbyters, and which the Church of <hi>England</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends on all Sundaies and Feſtivals, is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of doors, to three or four times a year: But alſo all the publick Service of God,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:115786:171"/> by Prayer, Reading the Scriptures, and the Praiſes of God, forbidden, when the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers mouth opens not: And, by referring the form of Prayer, and matter of Doctrine, to each mans diſcretion, the exerciſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is turned into a Lecture of State, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into the conſcience of the hearers, by deſiring of God the intereſſe of that faction for which a man Preaches. And by this means, they that doe challenge to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the title of Apoſtles, when they ſtyle themſelves <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>of the Goſpel,</hi> are now diſcovered, by their adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Congregations, to be Miniſters of that Power which ſet them up, as indeed they muſt needs be, when a double number of Votes in their Presbyteries, is able to caſt them out of the Church, if they prove not faithfull <hi>Miniſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ruine of Chriſtianity is yet greater, in going about to Reform Religion by the Sword, and taking up Arms upon the Title of Chriſtianity, whether it be pretended or not. For, they that ſay, that the Chriſtians of <hi>Tertullians</hi> time, would have defended themſelves by force, againſt the perſecutions of the Romane Emperors, if they had been able, muſt needs ſay, that Chriſtians may and ought to defend themſelves, upon the Title of their Chriſtianity: As both <hi>Bucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nane</hi>
                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:115786:171"/> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> by conſequence muſt doe, when they ſay, that the reaſon why S. <hi>Paul</hi> commands Chriſtians to be ſubject to the Secular Powers of his time, was, becauſe they were not able to reſiſt. But I doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to have read in <hi>Burroughs</hi> his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures on <hi>Hoſes,</hi> (which I ſpeak to doe him right) that the Title of this War is not grounded on Religion, as Religion, but as profeſſed by this Kingdome. Which, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive cannot be ſaid by thoſe that advance the Covenant, or allow two clauſes of it. The firſt, when it promiſeth <hi>to maintain the Kings perſon and eſtate in maintenance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:</hi> For, if the maintenance of the State be limited within the condition of Religion, then it is profeſſed by conſequence, that the Soveraign Power of the State is not to be maintained, when Religion is not maintained by it, which if it did maintain, Religion were to be maintained. Therefore Religion is the ground, upon which thoſe that enter into the Covenant undertake to maintain one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without any exception in the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the ſame. Therefore that War is made upon the Title of Religion, which maintains not the State but in the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of it. The ſecond, when it faith, that this is done, <hi>that thoſe which grone under the yoke of Antichriſt, may be moved to do the like.</hi>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:115786:172"/> Which, belonging to the Subjects of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Princes, profeſſeth Religion to be the Title of thoſe Arms, which all of like Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may uſe, what ever the State be under which they live. Now would I fain know of any friend of the Covenant, What is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between it and the Holy League of <hi>France</hi> under <hi>Henry</hi> the third, as to this point, and in this regard? There is indeed difference enough, between the ſubjects in which the two Leagues ſuppoſe Religion to conſiſt, and there is as much in the Rule of the ſame, which both ſuppoſe: But as to the right which Religion introduceth, of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it ſelf by force, both Covenants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in ſuppoſing it. And thereby, found temporall right upon the Grace of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, contrary to that which I preſuppoſe from the beginning, ſeeing whatſoever is purchaſed by ſuch Arms, is the production of that Title under which they are born. True it is, that Religion is not the onely Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of that League or this Covenant, both of them pretending as well abuſe in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But it is to be conſidered on the other ſide, that theſe two Titles are not ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate but concurrent: That is, that this Right of maintaining Religion by force of Arms, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from the truth of Religion in it ſelf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed, and not by the eſtabliſhment of
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:115786:172"/> Religion by the Laws of any State, for the Religion of the ſame: Becauſe not by that Power by which theſe Laws were made. And therefore, by conſequence, makes thoſe, that take Arms, and joyn in Covenant, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judges of all that is queſtioned in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Which being of much more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to all Chriſtians, then the good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of any Commonwealth, though both Titles concurre in this War, yet it would be poſſible, that War might be made upon the Title of Religion alone, contrary to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. The learned <hi>Caſaubon</hi> once called the Doctrine of <hi>Gregory</hi> the VII <hi>Pope,</hi> when he undertook to deprive Chriſtian Princes of their Eſtates, becauſe they ſtood Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, <hi>Haereſim Hildebrandinam, The Hereſie of Pope Hildebrand:</hi> And not without cauſe. For, ſeeing the foundation of Chriſtianity conſiſteth in things to be done, as well as things to be beleeved, and that the ſumme of that which Chriſtians profeſſe to do, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in bearing Chriſts Croſſe, how ſhall he be other then an Heretick, that renounceth the profeſſion of Chriſts Croſſe? Or how can he be underſtood to profeſſe Chriſts Croſſe, that holds any thing purchaſed by the Arms which are born upon the Title of Chriſtianity? For as all is his that conquers in lawfull Arms, ſo cannot he be underſtood
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:115786:173"/> to renounce all for Chriſts Croſſe, that holds any thing by it, which he is bound to maintain, with the Title whereby he holds it. Thus that Pope is not unjuſtly called an Heretick by ſome, as Hereſie imports a vice of a particular mans minde, not a Sect in the Society of the Church, ſeeing it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid that this poſition is enjoined, though ſuffered in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it muſt be ſaid of that Church, the Society whereof, and the Power which governeth that Society, ſubſiſteth by Arms grounded on Chriſtianity. Therefore ſuppoſing an Eccleſiaſticall Power, and by conſequence a Church conſtituted by force uſed upon this ground, it would be hard to clear it of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, the conſtitution whereof cannot ſtand with the profeſſion of Chriſts Croſſe.</p>
               <p>But not to aggravate conſequences, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is manifeſt, that all errors in Religion overthrow the foundation by conſequence, but to ſhew what regret I have to ſay that which I muſt not conceal, I will advance the onely poſſible expedient that I can imagine, to reſtore the Unity of the Church among us. For, that of a Nationall Synod, which is moſt obvious and plauſible, ſeems to me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be uſed lawfully and effectually both in our caſe. I am not ſo faintly in love with the Cauſe which I expoſe my ſelf to ſo
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:115786:173"/> much offenſe to maintain, as to make a queſtion how the Church of <hi>England</hi> were to be re-eſtabliſhed if right might take place, that is, by re-eſtating the Synod thereof in full poſſeſſion of that right which hereby I have proved, that they are outed of onely by force. But I ſpeak now upon ſuppoſition, that there is force on their ſide that refuſe this right, upon opinions contrary to the ſame, and with an intent to advance a courſe, by which it may be diſcerned, how farre the Church of <hi>England</hi> may abate of the right which is denied onely by force, for ſo good a purpoſe, as to reconcile unto it thoſe, who may otherwiſe fall into Churches in name, but Schiſms indeed. And in this caſe my reaſon is, becauſe, thoſe who chalenge the right of a Synod muſt proceed as authorized to judge between, or rather to give Law to all parties: Now, being divided as we are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Right, and force, or the opinion of either or both, it is not imaginable, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe that think themſelves to have Right, can, or thoſe that think themſelves to have force, will ſubmit to receive ſentence or Law from their adverſaries, unleſſe we think them either no men, to change their judgement when they come to have Power on their ſide, or no Chriſtians, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that to be Right, which they are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:115786:174"/> is not. What remains then to reſtore peace, when no party can yeeld? Surely, in all bodily diſeaſes, thoſe parts and principles, and elements of nature which remain untain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, muſt be the means to recover the whole: And in this diſtemper of the Church, ſo much of Chriſtianity as remains commonly acknowledged by all parties, rightly husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, may ſerve to reunite them in one, upon better intelligence. And, the deſpair which any party ought to have, of reducing the reſt to themſelves, ought to perſwade all to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to this good husbandry. What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains then common to all parts, beſide the profeſſion of Chriſtianity &amp; the Scriptures, to agree them about the meaning and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of them, in matters queſtionable, being that which remains in debate? Could I ſay that all parts acknowledged, that which the Church from the beginning, every where, hath received and uſed, to be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Scripture, I ſhould think the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe half done: But ſince it is otherwiſe, we muſt have recourſe to a more remote ground, or principle, which may ſerve for a reaſon to produce thoſe conſequences, which follow from the ſaid Rule, in matters in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, ſeeing we pretend not to make a Rule without cauſe. And this muſt be, by exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the firſt motives of Chriſtianity, for
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:115786:174"/> what reaſons we undertake the profeſſion of it, which, being well rendred, and ſhot home to the mark, will not fail, either to decide any thing in controverſie, or to ſhew, that it concerns no mans Chriſtianity, that it be decided. Now, the onely means to bring forth and diſcharge theſe reaſons to publick ſatisfaction, is an open and free Conference, for ſpace of time, or perſons, executed by perſons advanced by the ſeverall parties, to improve what any man can bring forth, to the clearing of any thing in debate, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by perſons choſen for their diſcretion, to keep the debate from wandring, till all be ſaid to all points. For, ſeeing it muſt needs appear, what are the terms of agreement, when all reaſons are ſpent, it will be lawfull for thoſe, in whom reſts the Succeſſion of the Apoſtles, and all claiming under them, to conſent to eſtate the Eccleſiaſticall Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the Miniſtery of Eccleſiaſticall Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, upon perſons to be agreed upon accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to terms agreed: And this conſent, as effectuall to reunite the Church, as ever an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently Schiſms were lawfully reſtored to the Church, by admitting Biſhops, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Deacons, and People, to communicate in their own ranks, and making good all acts done in Separation, by ſubſequent conſent, not as to God, but as to the Church, which
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:115786:175"/> I have ſhewed afore was many times done. As for thoſe which have uſed this Power al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, they ſhall condeſcend no further by this agreement, but to uſe that part of it, which ſhall be limited them by the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon an unqueſtionable title for the future.</p>
               <p>But, if our ſins be ſtill ſo powerfull, as not to ſuffer a lawfull courſe to take place, let me admoniſh thoſe infinite numbers of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſouls, that ſigh and groan after the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Church, what means God ſhews them to diſcharge the conſcience of good Chriſtians to him, while the temporall Laws of the State, which ought to actuate it, doe ſuſpend their Office: Which are in effect, the perſons of thoſe in whom the Succeſſion of the Apoſtles is veſted, and the Clergy claiming under them: And that generall Law of Chriſtianity, (for which thoſe things which we inſiſt upon cannot be quitted) of ſticking to all that the Church originally, always, every where, hath profeſſed and uſed. From them let them ſeek the communion of the Church, not onely in the exerciſe of ſuch Chriſtian Ordinances, as men, caſt upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert coaſts, and utterly deſtitute of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Society for the preſent, (for ſo our diſtractions have made us) can participate in, but alſo, in ſuch acts of the Power of the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:115786:175"/> Keys, as paſſe not the inward court of the conſcience. Neither let them ever think themſelves neceſſitated to communicate with Schiſme, while the Law which is the ſource of all Laws, and the perſons which are the ſeed of all publick perſons of the Church continue. And let them know further, that in adhering to the Society of a Church never ſo much deſtroied by force, no Secular Power, whether lawfull or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, ſhall ever have more rightfull title to perſecute them, then the Romane Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours had to perſecute the Apoſtles and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians, part of their profeſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not to defend themſelves by force grounded upon the title of Chriſtianity, but to ſuffer with patience what force ſhall inflict for it. Which doing, as the purchaſe is not of this world, ſo let them not doubt to finde the effect of the promiſes which are to come.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince the writing of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I have underſtood by relation, and by ſome Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, that there is one opinion on foot, among the many of this time, that there is no ſuch thing as a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the Church, by the Ordinance of our Lord, and the inſtitution of his Apoſtles; That, whereſoever we reade of the Church in the Scriptures, there we are to underſtand no more, but onely a number of men that are Chriſtians, who may or ought to aſſemble together for the ſervice of God, as they find opportunity and means: But, that there ſhould be thought to be any condition of communicating in the Service of God, which ſhould make all Chriſtians a Society, called the Church, as excluding thoſe that are not qualified with it, this they think to
<pb n="II" facs="tcp:115786:177"/> be an Impoſture that hath made way for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt. And though this opinion be ſo groundleſſe, that very few Readers will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any oppoſition to be made; yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my intent was, by this Diſcourſe, to improve the Reaſons heretofore advanced, and to try the effect and conſequence of them, in deſtroying the grounds of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions framed among us; And becauſe, if that which I propound be the truth, it will, with a little husbanding, be effectuall to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince all manner of errors, it will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite here to give notice, that all the reaſons which this firſt Chapter produceth, to prove the Power of the Keys, and the puniſhment of Excommunication, the effect thereof, to belong to the Church, are effectuall to prove the Society of the Church, which this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er conſtitutes, and therefore the effect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of evidenceth. And truly, though there is an infinite diſtance between the productions and conſequences of this opinion, and that of <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> (in as much as this manifeſtly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to challenge to all Chriſtians freedome of doing what they pleaſe in the exerciſe of their Chriſtianity, without any account to the State under which they live; that of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſtus</hi> challenging to the State all Power to govern all Chriſtians in their Chriſtianity) yet, if we conſider the ground on which both
<pb n="III" facs="tcp:115786:177"/> ſtand, they will appear to be as the Rivers that riſe out of <hi>Apenninus,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> empty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſome into the Sea of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> others into the Gulf of <hi>Venice.</hi> For, I ſuppoſe, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans common reaſon will furniſh him ſo much of the metaphyſicks, as to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that every thing which hath a beeing, is by that beeing diſtinct from other things: So that, if there be no difference between the Society of the Church, and that of the State, when it profeſſes Chriſtianity, but that both make one Community, Corporation, or Commonwealth, as that of the ancient peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God under the Law; then is there no Society of a Church, when the State is Chriſtian, ſeeing it is agreed upon on all hands, that there is one of the State, and this opinion inforces, that there is no more but one. True it is, that there are two things to ſay, either that, before <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the Power of Excommunication ſtood onely by Humane right, that is, by cuſtome of the Church, or that, by the Ordinance of our Lord and his Apoſtles, it was to ſtand onely before Chriſtianity were received by King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Commonwealths, but afterwards, the Power of governing the Church, hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in the Body of the Church, to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the Secular Power of the State. But whether this or that, in all caſes, he that
<pb n="IV" facs="tcp:115786:178"/> taketh away the Power of the Keys in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and that of Excommunication in ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the Church, muſt needs appear to take away the Society and Communion of a Church, either becauſe it never was, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ceaſeth when the State becomes Chriſtian. This conſideration improves ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much the reaſons of this Chapter againſt <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> making his opinion liable to all thoſe Scriptures, which acknowledge a Society of the Church, and the ſenſe of all Chriſtians which ſuppoſe the ſame: And deſerveth here to be repreſented, becauſe it may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the proceeding of the Diſcourſe, did not give leave to preſſe it to this effect. For, the intent of it being to limit the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of Secular and Eccleſiaſticall Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Church matters, it was neceſſary to declare in the firſt place, upon what ground God hath inſtituted the Society of the Church, by Revelation from above, having before conſtituted civile Societies of the ſame perſons whereof the Church conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, by the Law of Nature and Nations, and the operation of his ordinary Providence. Eſpecially, ſeeing that Chriſtianity addreſſeth it ſelf to all Nations, and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to conſtitute one Church of all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Societies which imbrace the ſame. For, ſeeing it is manifeſt, that Religion hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="V" facs="tcp:115786:178"/> been a very generall Title of many Wars and commotions againſt the Publick peace, and that therefore all States muſt needs be jealous of that Religion, which asks no leave of the State to beleeve what it beleeves, but profeſſes an obligation of beleeving, though never ſo contrary to the Laws of the State, it appears to have been requiſite, that there ſhould be in Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſome condition that might clear it from this jealouſie; eſpecially, becauſe one Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the Church, conſiſting of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which conſtitute many States, muſt needs be concluded in point of conſcience, by a Power of the Church, not derived from that of the State, and ſo, poſſibly, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of a State, be concluded in conſcience by ſtrangers to that State, as they are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church. This is the difficulty, which was to be removed in the beginning of this Diſcourſe, that it might appear no ways prejudiciall to civile Societies, that God ſhould inſtitute one Society of the Church, to conſiſt of all perſons of ſeverall States, that profeſſe Chriſtianity. And, the removing of this difficulty conſiſts in the right underſtanding of Chriſts Croſſe, and the profeſſion of it, which is the ſubſtance of Chriſtianity. For, if we be called to the Croſſe of Chriſt by our Chriſtianity, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="VI" facs="tcp:115786:179"/> thereby be called to any advantage, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, or poſſeſſion of this world, which we have not by our quality in the State. And when it is ſaid, that temporall dominion is not founded in Grace, it is as much as if it were ſaid, that it is not founded in Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, becauſe the great Grace of God in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt, is the ground of all other grace tending to life everlaſting. Now, if Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity import no right, no intereſſe, no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of this world, but maintaineth the State of this world, in the ſame condition which it findeth, when the world imbraces Chriſtianity, becauſe it obligeth all men to yeeld obedience to Soveraign Powers, (which maintain all men in poſſeſsion of their rights) for conſcience ſake, then is the difficulty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, neither can it be prejudiciall to States, that the perſons whereof they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, are called by God to a Society of the Church, ſubſiſting by the grant and patent of God, and not of any State.</p>
               <p>If it be thus, the queſtion will be asked in the next place, How a Society of men can ſubſiſt in this world, without any privilege or right of this world; and, ſeeing it muſt be the grant of ſome privilege from God, which the world gives not, that muſt make the Church a Society, Community, Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Spirituall Commonwealth, what this
<pb n="VII" facs="tcp:115786:179"/> privilege is, and wherein it conſiſteth. For, to the conſtitution of this Society, there goes more then to beleeve the Faith with the heart, which, being of it ſelf inviſible, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſufficient to conſtitute the Society of the Church, which muſt be viſible: More then to profeſſe Chriſtianity to the world; for ſo doe they, we ſee, that diſpute, that there is no ſuch thing as any Society of the Church, becauſe they ſuppoſe not, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity obligeth them to communicate in the publick Service of God, and the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances wherein it conſiſteth: But, this being ſuppoſed, together with the condition upon which men are admitted to Chriſtianity, as the condition upon which they communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in the ſame, there needs nothing elſe to make the Church ſuch a Society as we ſpeak of. It may perhaps ſeem ſtrange, that this privilege, of holding Aſſemblies for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service of God, and the obligation which all Chriſtians are under, of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating in the ſame, ſhould be advanced for the ground upon which all the right of the Church ſtandeth, ſeeing it is but collected by conſequence, and not expreſly laid down in the Scriptures, that there is ſuch a Precept or privilege. For, that this is the ground up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Society of the Church ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and the ſource from whence all the
<pb n="VIII" facs="tcp:115786:180"/> right thereof iſſueth, is not matter of faith or ſalvation, but of Theologicall Diſcourſe, by conſequence of reaſon to be drawn out of the Scripture, without which, they may be as good Chriſtians, which, without it, cannot acquit themſelves of thoſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which, he that knoweth the ground from whence the rights of the Church by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of reaſon may be deduced, ſhall be able to reſolve. Here then we have a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, becauſe granted by God againſt all the Powers of the world, not as to uſe any force of this world to defend our ſelves in it, for then ſhould the Power of the Sword depend upon the conſtitution of the Church, but as to God, to ſecure Chriſtians in conſcience to God, in caſe they diſobey the Powers of the world, to whom they are always bound to be ſubject, when they forbid them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in the Service of God at the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of the Church, which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth: But no privilege of this world, which counts it no advantage, to ſuffer for that duty to God, which fleſh and bloud could ſpare with eaſe. And, by virtue of this Patent, or Charter-privilege from God, the Church is conſtituted a Viſible Society and Community of all Chriſtians, though to an inviſible purpoſe. It will not be out of the way to remember here a paſſage of <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
                  <pb n="IX" facs="tcp:115786:180"/> Epiſtles, X. 97. by which it may appear, how the Aſſemblies of the Church were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the Romanes, when he ſays, that the Apoſtate Chriſtians pleaded for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they had not frequented the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of the Church, ſince that, (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the inſtructions of <hi>Trajane)</hi> he had by his Edict interdicted Corporations, which he cals <hi>Hetaerias,</hi> and the Laws <hi>Collegia</hi> or Colleges, <hi>Digeſt.</hi> XLVII. 23. For, ſeeing on the one ſide <hi>Tertullian, de Jejunio cap.</hi> XIII. argueth upon ſuppoſition, that the Aſſemblies of Chriſtians were not againſt the Laws when he writ; on the other ſide, it appears, by the Laws 1 <hi>&amp;</hi> 3 <hi>ff. de Collegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is &amp; Corporibus,</hi> that the Emperors, by their inſtructions to the Governours of Provinces, and the Senate by their Decrees, did make ſuch Societies unlawfull, as often as they found cauſe; it ſeems that, ſo often as they pleaſed, they compriſed the Chriſtians with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thoſe Laws, and that, when the Chriſtians were compriſed in thoſe Laws, their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies were thereby interdicted, as they were by <hi>Plinies</hi> Edict. <hi>Joſephus</hi> truly, <hi>Antiq.</hi> XIV. 17. recordeth a Decree of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> by which he declareth, that, when he interdicted other Societies of that nature, he excepted the Aſſemblies of the Jews: So that, ſince it appears, that, for divers years after the
<pb n="X" facs="tcp:115786:181"/> death of our Lord, the Chriſtians went for Jews without diſtinction at <hi>Rome,</hi> it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that, at the firſt, they were not inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into by any Law of this kinde, becauſe the Jews were not liable to the like. But that, when they were inquired into, they held themſelves tied to aſſemble notwithſtanding theſe Laws, appears by <hi>Pliny,</hi> becauſe it is manifeſt, that thoſe who pleaded for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they had left the Aſſemblies of the Church, were Apoſtates. This privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of holding Aſſemblies, granted Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity by Divine right, on purpoſe to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the Community of the Church, is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in that notable Diſcourſe of S. <hi>Paul, Eph.</hi> IV. 4-16. wherein the Apoſtle decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, as I have ſhewed <hi>p.</hi> 218. that God hath appointed two ſorts of Graces in his Church, which may be diſtinguiſhed by the terms of corporall and ſpirituall: Corporall, in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the aſſemblies thereof by the goods of this world; and ſpirituall, in edifying the Church to the perfection of Chriſtianity, at thoſe Aſſemblies. So that, the end of all the Graces, which God hath given his Church, being the edification of the Church, &amp; the means of that edification, the frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Aſſemblies thereof, and the condition of that means, the Unity of the Church, it muſt needs appear, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="XI" facs="tcp:115786:181"/> ſuppoſeth a Society of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he argueth upon the means which God hath provided, to maintain the viſible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies thereof in Unity, ſo that all might be edified, at thoſe Aſſemblies, to perfection in Chriſtianity. For, ſeeing the unity of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Aſſemblies, importeth the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of all Chriſtians, in all the Offices of Divine Service, it is manifeſt, that he which requireth the Unity of Eccleſiaſticall Aſſemblies, ſuppoſeth a Society of the Church, to procure and maintain the ſame. But it is not this paſſage of S. <hi>Paul</hi> alone, wherein this privilege is ſuppoſed, intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or expreſſed, but, whereſoever there is mention in any part of Scriptures, of any Ordinance of the Service of God, inſtituted or exerciſed at the Aſſemblies of Gods faithfull people, (provided that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear otherwiſe, by the Scripture, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the Law and the Goſpel) there you have the Charter or Patent of this grant and privilege, and, by conſequence, of the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the Church founded upon it.</p>
               <p>But, though <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſecurely taketh it for granted, that Chriſtian States have right to exerciſe their Soveraign Power in Church matters, becauſe it was ſo in the Synagogue, yet I doe not underſtand how he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them that at this time deny this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="XII" facs="tcp:115786:182"/> among us: Seeing there is ſo much difference between the Law and the Goſpel, between the Church and the Synagogue, that, that which is held in the one, cannot be preſumed to hold under the other, without a reaſon common to both. And ſo far as that reaſon prevails, and no further, muſt the Power and Intereſſe of States in Church matters be underſtood to prevail. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is a ſaying of S. <hi>Jeromes,</hi> which may juſtly move a tender ſpirit to doubt, whether this Intereſſe of States in Church matters be from God or not: For, ſeeing it is moſt true, and viſible to experience, which he ſays, <hi>Eccleſiam poſtquam coepit habere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianos Magiſtratus, factam eſſe opibus majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, virtutibus autem minorem: That the Church, ſince it began to have Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, is become greater in wealth,</hi> or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>but leſſe in virtues:</hi> And, that it is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in reaſon, that, that which goeth before, is the cauſe of that which followeth upon it, when no other cauſe appeareth, well may it be doubted, that the Intereſſe of Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Powers in Church matters is not from God, from which, ſo great a decay of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity proceedeth, which muſt not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to any thing which God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. To which agreeth that Legend in the life of Pope <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> which ſaith, that when
<pb n="XIII" facs="tcp:115786:182"/> 
                  <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had endowed the Church ſo largely, there was a voice from heaven heard to ſay, <hi>Hodie venenum effuſum eſt in Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, To day is there poiſon poured out upon the Church.</hi> The reaſon then, which here I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, upon which, the Kings of Gods ancient people had that power in maters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which by the Scriptures we know they did exerciſe, I hope will appear reaſonable, to them that have peruſed the IV Chapter, and ſeen, how it is not deſtructive, but cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulative to that, which, by the Law, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Law, is given to the Conſiſtory. And, ſince it accrued to the King, not by the Law, becauſe not conſtituted by it, but by the deſire of the People, admitted, and aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto by God, by which he became Head of a People already in Covenant with God, what difference is there between this caſe, and the caſe of a whole people, together with the Powers of the ſame, converted to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, but this, that the Iſraelites were in Covenant with God before they were under Kings, (for though <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Judges had Regall Power, yet it was not by a ſtanding Law) Chriſtian Nations, under the Powers of the World, before they became Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an? Unleſſe it be further, that the Church is one of all Nations, the Synagogue, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall extent with the People of <hi>Iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ael,</hi> which
<pb n="XIV" facs="tcp:115786:183"/> is not of conſequence to this purpoſe. The Apoſtle, rendring a reaſon, why he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands Secular Powers to be prayed for at the Aſſemblies of the Church, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> II. 2, 3, 4. aſſigneth the end of them to be, <hi>That we may lead a quiet life in all godlineſſe and honeſty:</hi> Which is manifeſtly ſaid in reſpect of Secular Powers that are not Chriſtian: For of them the Church juſtly expects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and quietneſſe, paying them prayers, ſubjection, and duties. But he addes further this reaſon; <hi>Becauſe this is good and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God our Saviour, who would have no man to periſh, but to come to the knowledge of his truth.</hi> If then, the will of God be, that the Soveraign Powers of the Gentiles be converted to Chriſtianity, is it not his will that they imploy themſelves to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, not onely as Chriſtians, but as Soveraigns, which cannot be expected from Gentiles? There is reaſon therefore to ground this Intereſſe, upon the declared will of God, concerning the calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, the Apoſtle having declared, that their Secular Powers are invited to the Faith, and the Propheſies of the Old Teſtament having declared, that their Kings &amp; Queens ſhould come to the Church and advance it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> II. 10, 11, 12. LXXII. 10, 11. <hi>Eſ.</hi> XLIX. 23. LX. 13. This reaſon is far more effectuall
<pb n="XV" facs="tcp:115786:183"/> to me, by the Propheſies left the Church in the <hi>Apocalypſe;</hi> The main ſcope and drift whereof, I am much perſwaded to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but to foretell the converſion of the Romane Empire to Chriſtianity, and the puniſhment of the Heathens that perſecuted the ſame. For, if the intent of thoſe Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies be to ſhew, that it was Gods will, that the Empire ſhould become Chriſtian, and that the reign of the Saints upon earth there foretold, is nothing elſe, but the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſtianity to the Government of the Empire, and, by conſequence, of other Kingdomes, into which the Empire was to be diſſolved, it cannot be doubted, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Powers attain the ſame right in matters of Religion, which the Kings of Gods anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent People always had, by the making of Chriſtianity the Religion of any State. This opinion it was not my purpoſe to publiſh, at the writing of this Diſcourſe, becauſe it is like to become a mark of contradiction to the moſt part, being poſſeſſed, more or leſſe, of a far other ſenſe. But having conſidered ſince how many and horrible ſcandals are on foot, by the conſequences of that ſenſe, (ſo that I cannot condemne my ſelf of giving ſcandall, by publiſhing the beſt means I can ſee to take it away) and, having met with another reaſon, neceſſitating me to declare
<pb n="XVI" facs="tcp:115786:184"/> it, for the effectuall proceeding of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I will put it down in the Review of the laſt Chapter, where that neceſſity riſes, deſiring thoſe that ſeek further ſatisfaction in this reaſon, to reade it there for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. As for the objection that was made, from the decay of Chriſtianity, after the Powers of the World protected it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched the Church, it is a meer miſtake, of that which is accidentall, for the true cauſe. For, the coming in of the World to the Church, is one thing, and the Power of the State in Church matters is another, though this depend upon that: And it is true, that the coming of the World into the Church, was the decay of Chriſtianity, but the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the State in the Church, is a prop to ſuſtain it from utter ruine. Many people are many waters, <hi>Apoc.</hi> XVII. 15. but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is the wine that cometh from the Vine in the Goſpel, <hi>John</hi> XV. 1. This wine then, mixed with much water, that is, the Goſpel received by much people, retaineth not the true reliſh, in the works of them that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it. <hi>David</hi> ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> XVIII. 44, 45. <hi>A people whom I have not known ſhall ſerve me: At the report of me they will obey me: Strangers will lie to me.</hi> At the report of <hi>Davids</hi> victories, ſtrangers ſubmitted unto him: Some of whom nevertheleſſe were falſe
<pb n="XVII" facs="tcp:115786:184"/> hearted Subjects. This is the caſe of them that profeſſe Chriſtianity, and live not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it, who ſeem to have learned Machiavels principle, to join themſelves to that party which they mean to deſtroy. As the multitude that came with the Iſraelites out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> upon ſight of Gods miracles, ſet them on murmuring againſt God in their ſtraits, <hi>Exod.</hi> XII. 38. <hi>Num.</hi> XI. 4. The cold of winter concenters the heat of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, and fortifies digeſtion. So, the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of perſecution, fortified the Primitive Chriſtians to digeſt it: But the heat of the air entices forth naturall heat, and diſpoſes to putrefaction: So the peace of the Church diſſolveth the beſt reſolutions for Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. For, as the ſtomack cannot order and govern that abundance of crude and undige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted humours, which the weakneſſe of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heat breeds, ſo neither can the diſcipline of the Church hold thoſe in compaſſe, that come not to Chriſtianity with ſo ſtrong a reſolution as to ſuffer for it. The cauſe then of the corruption of diſcipline, is the coming of all ſorts to Chriſtianity, whether for faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſake, or for hope of advantage, which <hi>Euſebius</hi> hath obſerved that it was viſible in <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time. As for the Power of the State in Church matters, it is ordained for a counterpoiſon to this miſchief, to give that
<pb n="XVIII" facs="tcp:115786:185"/> force to the diſcipline of the Church, which carnall Chriſtians would not ſubmit to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. The Apoſtles in their time had a power to inflict bodily puniſhment upon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> upon <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> upon <hi>Elymas,</hi> which, in excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, he cals delivering to Satan, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, by ſome plague on the body, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they came within his power by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excommunicate. This power it is which the Apoſtle cals <hi>the Rod,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> IV. 21. and of it his meaning is when he ſays, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> X. 6. <hi>That he was ready to puniſh all diſobedience when their obedience ſhould be complete.</hi> To me therfore it ſeems more then probable, which hath been conceived of late, that God provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this extraordinary gift, expreſly for thoſe times, when the Church was deſtitute of the protection of Secular Powers, as on the contrary, that, againſt the time that this gift ceaſed, he provided the protection of Secular Powers, for the maintenance of Chriſtianity. Theſe things thus debated, it will be worth the conſidering, how, by the appointment of God it neceſſarily comes to paſſe, that the Power of the Church, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon a very mean and inconſiderable privilege, (as to the world) of aſſembling for the publick Service of God, coms to be of greateſt conſideration, in ſwaying the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt
<pb n="XIX" facs="tcp:115786:185"/> affaires of Chriſtian Kingdomes and Comonwealths. And, in conſequence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, not what diſcretion, but what juſtice there is in thoſe vain diſcourſes, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the Clergy of ſuch times, that meanneſſe, and poverty, and contemptible eſtate and condition of living, which our Lord and diſciples ſpent their time in from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. Not conſidering, that, by the ſame reaſon, the people of the Church muſt not continue ſuch as now they are, but muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to be ſuch as then they were: That the right of the Church cannot be maintained in effect, without a Power anſwerable to the body that is to be governed by it, nor that Power maintained, without a ſupport pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable. And, that Chriſtianity is not neceſſarily ſeen, in having or not having this or that eſtate in this world, but in uſing the Power, with that meekneſſe, and charity, and uprightneſſe, the goods of this world, with that temperance, continence, and freedome of heart which Chriſtianity requires. Nor is it to be doubted, that the Church was poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with thoſe riches which the Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Empire caſt upon it: But not by having thoſe riches, but by the manners of the people, which, comming into the Church corrupted with the love of them, muſt needs, by conſequence, corrupt the Clergy whom
<pb n="XX" facs="tcp:115786:186"/> they came ſo near. In fine, that the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Church in a Chriſtian State, conſiſts not in ſtripping the Church either of Power or Poſſeſſions, but in providing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Laws for the uſe of them, and the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame.</p>
               <p>You may have obſerved, that, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, I have declared, the Society of the Church, to be founded upon a Command from God to all Chriſtians, of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating in the publick Service of God, (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing an obligation to God, and therefore to the World, a Privilege of doing it, though the Powers of the World forbid it to be done) &amp; upon a Law, for the condition, under which they are admitted to communicate in it. Of this Precept, or of the obligation and privilege depending upon it, I have hitherto made evidence. That which remains to make the proof of my purpoſe complete, is, to ſhew that there is a Law given by God, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition under which men are admitted to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the Church: For, ſeeing the execution of this Law muſt needs be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Church, that is, to Chriſtians, (not ſuppoſing for the preſent the Church to be a Society, but onely a multitude of Chriſtians, nor diſputing what part of the Church, or what perſons in the Church, are truſted with the execution thereof
<pb n="XXI" facs="tcp:115786:186"/> in behalf of the Church) upon this truſt followeth immediately that common Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which conſtituteth the Society of the Church. Which Power, becauſe it is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the obligation, or the privilege of holding Aſſemblies for the common Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, therefore the act wherein it is immediately ſeen, is the voiding of any mans right to communicate in the Offices of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, at the common aſſemblies of the Church for that purpoſe. I ſay it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſeen in this act, when it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete: Otherwiſe it is to be conceived, that, as it is exerciſed, ſo alſo it may be ſaid to be ſeen more immediately, in all thoſe acts which tend to Excommunication, as degrees or ſteps to it, which is the utmoſt that the Church, as the Church, can doe, being the taking away of a Chriſtians life, as to the Church, as the greateſt works of State Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice are, the taking away of the Naturall or Civile beeing of any member of it. Seeing then, the utmoſt Power of the Church is uſed in Excommunication, it follows, that it is evidenced and ſeen by Excommunication, that is to ſay, that all reaſons which ſhew the Church to be endowed with the Power of Excommunication, do ſhew it to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted a Society, Community, Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſpirituall Commonwealth, by the
<pb n="XXII" facs="tcp:115786:187"/> Power of doing it. Now the Law which is the condition upon which men are admitted to communicate with the Church, is nothing elſe but the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, upon which, the Apoſtles of our Lord were firſt enabled to conſtitute Churches, by bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing them whom they ſhould win to be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, according to the Commiſſion of our Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> XXVIII. 19. thoſe onely being Diſciples which undertook Chriſtianity, and therefore were afterwards called Chriſtians, being firſt called Diſciples, even after their Baptiſm. Now, Chriſtianity conſiſting, not onely in beleeving whatſoever our Lord Chriſt revealed, but in the acknowledgement of an obligation to doe whatſoever he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; it follows, that this Law of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity conſiſts of all Precepts, of things to be beleeved, and things to be done, which our Lord Chriſt hath declared to his Church. And not in theſe alone, in regard that our Lord hath commanded Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not onely to be beleeved, but alſo to be profeſſed, at the utmoſt perill of life and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: Therefore I ſaid, that the Law, which is the condition of communicating with the Church, is the profeſsion of Chriſtianity, which entitleth to Baptiſm. This profeſsion, ſeeing it cannot be made but to Chriſtians, that know what Chriſtianity is, and thereby
<pb n="XXIII" facs="tcp:115786:187"/> are able to judge of the profeſſion made, how agreeable to Chriſtianity, of the perſon making the profeſsion, how ſincerely, how cordially he does it, it followeth, that the Power of the Church is committed to them that are truſted to judge of the profeſsion of Chriſtianity, every one according to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſe which he juſtly pretendeth in that judgement. Therefore is this Power called the Power of the Keys, becauſe it openeth the doore to the Communion of all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Divine Service in the Church, when it findeth the profeſsion both agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Chriſtianity, and to the heart &amp; life of him that makes it, and ſhuts the ſame when it findeth things otherwiſe. Therefore is it called the Power of remitting, and retaining ſinnes, becauſe God hath promiſed the free grace of remiſsion of ſins, to all that make true profeſsion of Chriſtianity: The benefit of which promiſe, as it is good to him that makes ſuch profeſsion, by virtue of his own act, as to God, ſo, by virtue of the act that admits of the ſame, it is good as to the Church: Though it cannot be good as to God, unleſſe it be good alſo as to the Church, by reaſon of the command of God, that every Chriſtian be a member of the Church. For, if it were morally poſsible, that any man ſhould attain to the knowlege,
<pb n="XXIV" facs="tcp:115786:188"/> and ſubmit to the obedience of Chriſtianity in ſuch an eſtate of life, and ſuch Society of this World, wherein it were not morally poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to hold Communion with the Church, or thoſe, who in behalfe of the Church, by the Laws of it, are enabled to admit him to the Communion of the ſame by Baptiſm, I would make no ſcruple to think that man in the ſtate of ſalvation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Baptiſm, or the Church. And the ſame is to be ſaid of all thoſe, that cannot be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Communion of the Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out profeſsing, or doing ſomething contrary to Chriſtianity, which is the caſe of all that ſtand excommunicate upon unjuſt cauſes, ſo that their Chriſtianity obligeth them to communicate with no part of the true Church. For ſeeing the Unity of the Church requires, that he that is excommunicate to one part of the Church, be excommunicate to all the Church, (ſeeing the Unity of the Whole cannot be preſerved, unleſſe the Whole make good each act of the part, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> it hath power to doe) it follows, that he who is excommunicate for an unjuſt cauſe, cannot with his Chriſtianity communicate with any part of the Church, his title to heaven re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining entire. But this caſe ceaſing, the remiſsion of ſins depends upon the Church, by reaſon of the profeſsion of Chriſtianity,
<pb n="XXV" facs="tcp:115786:188"/> which, as God requires every Chriſtian to make, ſo he enables the Church to admit. And this is the Argument for the Power of Excommunication, which is drawn from the Power of admitting to Baptiſm, eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by divers Scriptures, and divers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in the Primitive practice of the Church, agreeable to the ſame. And truly, it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to point at ſome particulars, for he that would undertake to produce all that is to be had, in the records of the Church, to depoſe for this reaſon, and this right of the Church, might eaſily fill great Volumes with nothing elſe. Nevertheleſſe I will here adde one particular more, becauſe it ſeems this reaſon of the right and intereſſe of the Church is evidently ſeen in it: And it will not require many allegations, ſeeing it is a known Rule of the ancient Church, that <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks</hi> ſhould not be admitted to the Clergy, alleged by <hi>Cornelius</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>Fabius</hi> of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> in <hi>Euſebius, Eccleſ. Hiſt.</hi> VI. 43. againſt <hi>Novatianus</hi> the Father of the Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, to ſhew, that he could not be Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in oppoſition to him, being made Presbyter contrary to that Rule. What was then the reaſon of this Rule, and what were they that were called <hi>Clinicks?</hi> It is very evident that there were very many in the Primitive times, that beleeved Chriſtianity,
<pb n="XXVI" facs="tcp:115786:189"/> but durſt not profeſſe it, becauſe it was no prejudice to beleeve it, but to profeſſe it, ſo as to be baptized, and come under the Diſcipline of the Church, might be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life and death in caſe of perſecution. Beſides, beleeving and not profeſſing, that is, not pretending to Baptiſm, they avoided the ſtrictneſſe of Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline. What ſhould the Church doe in the caſe of theſe men, when they came to demand their Baptiſm, undertaking the Rule of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? Surely, as they could not utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them from the Church, that had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver offended, or failed in that which they had undertook to it, ſo, of neceſſity, they muſt ſtand at a greater diſtance to ſuch perſons, as having their Chriſtianity more in ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then otherwiſe. Wherefore, in danger of death, they were not to refuſe them Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, but in caſe they recovered again, it was very reaſonable, that they which had attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their Baptiſm onely in conſideration of the danger of death, and muſt have given better triall of themſelves otherwiſe, before they were admitted, ſhould therefore ſtand ſo far ſuſpected afterwards, as not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Clergy, which required a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proficience in Chriſtianity, then that which qualified a man onely for Baptiſm. Theſe then are they which were called <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nici,</hi>
                  <pb n="XXVII" facs="tcp:115786:189"/> becauſe they were baptized in bed, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring their Baptiſm, when they found themſelves upon the bed of their ſickneſſe, which might be that of their death: And this is the reaſon of the Rule, that they ſhould not be admitted to the Clergy: And by this reaſon the right and intereſſe of the Church is evident, in admitting the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, in thoſe that thereby demanded to be admitted to Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>In the next argument, drawn from the Diſcipline of Penance, it may be thought that I make it a difficult task, to prove the Power of Excommunication to belong to the Church, when I premiſe to that purpoſe, an aſſumption ſo hard to beleeve as this is, that the Church, by the diſcipline of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, as well as by the practice and Rules of the Primitive times, was not bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admit to the Communion of the Church, thoſe that had fallen from their Chriſtianity, by ſins moſt deſtructive to the ſame. But it is to be conſidered, that, to the validity of this argument it is onely requiſite to ſhew, that thoſe that had fallen, were to ſue to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Penance in the firſt place, that, upon ſatisfaction given, of the ſincerity of their reſolution towards Chriſtianity, they might be readmitted to the Communion of the Church. All which ſuppoſeth, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="XXVIII" facs="tcp:115786:190"/> ſuch ſatisfaction given, they had forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſame. And the argument being effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall upon theſe terms, muſt needs convince ſo much the more, if it can further appear, that, in caſe of the moſt hainous offenſes, it was in the diſpoſition of the Church, to readmit them to Communion or not. Adde then, to the evidence hereof, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Marcion,</hi> Father of the Marcionites, in the beginning of his Hereſie in <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who, being put out of the Church, and deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Penance by his own Father, a Biſhop of great piety and zeal in <hi>Pontus,</hi> becauſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing continence, he had corrupted a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and afterwards at <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe of the Rule by which the whole Church ſubſiſteth, to make good the acts of all parts thereof, within the Power of thoſe parts, unleſſe voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſuperiours, fell hereupon to ſet up his Hereſie. And truly, ſo rigid a poſition as that of the Novatians, if it be conſidered aright, could very hardly have found any fellows, if it had been unheard of in the Church. But, though the Montaniſts were rejected at <hi>Rome,</hi> as to the point of receiving Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, ſeeing yet the queſtion remained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Apoſtates, ſo doubtfull, as to give <hi>Novatianus</hi> a party in it, what can be more manifeſt, then, that they had the pretenſe of Apoſtolicall diſcipline, and the Scriptures,
<pb n="XXIX" facs="tcp:115786:190"/> to ſet off their Schiſm with? A thing ſtill more evident, becauſe that, from the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that which paſſed between <hi>Cornelius</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Fabius</hi> of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> in <hi>Euſebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, Eccleſ. Hiſt.</hi> VI. 43, 44. it appeareth, that the Church of <hi>Antiochia</hi> remained for a time in ſuſpenſe, whether to acknowledge <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> or <hi>Novatianus</hi> for the right Biſhop. Whereupon, the Biſhops of the Eaſt, writing to <hi>Julius</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> from a Councell held at <hi>Antiochia,</hi> in <hi>Sozomenus Eccleſ. Hiſt.</hi> III. 8. doe reckon it as a motive to perſwade him not to interpoſe in the cauſe of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> depoſed by the Councell held there afore, that they alſo had formerly done the like in the caſe of <hi>Novatianus.</hi> And by this emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent inſtance we learn, how much the Unity of the Church is to be preferred before Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline. The name of Saints, and the like, in the Writings of the Apoſtles, is convertible with that of Chriſtians, being given to all the members of thoſe Churches, to which they addreſſe their Epiſtles: Though it be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by thoſe very Epiſtles, that, as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had foretold, ſo were thoſe Churches nets that held both good and bad fiſh, floors that had both corn and chaffe. What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of ſpeech is there then, to make good the language of the Apoſtles? Surely, if the Church be a viſible Society of men, ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="XXX" facs="tcp:115786:191"/> not by the nature of the perſons, but by inſtitution and appointment of voluntary acts, capable to qualifie them upon whom they paſſe, then, upon the conſtitution of members of the ſame, there muſt needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue unto them, qualities and denominations correſpondent to the acts upon which they ariſe. Now, the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, is not the proper and eſſentiall act of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may be feigned and fruitleſſe, but it is a ſign to ground a reaſonable preſumption upon, that the perſon is ſuch, as he is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon preſumed to be. But, being admitted to the Communion of the Church upon this preſumption, he purchaſes thereupon a Right to be taken for ſuch as thoſe are to be, ſo long as he continueth in the ſame. Now, if the diſcipline of Chriſtianity could be held up together with the Unity of the Church, then muſt it be underſtood, that the Church is commanded to exact it of all members of the Church, upon the ſame obligation, as it is commanded all Chriſtians for their ſouls health. But, though it be abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the ſalvation of Chriſtians, to live as Chriſtians, yet it is not ſo neceſſary for any Chriſtian, to procure that another Chriſtian doe it, therefore is the care of it comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Church, or whoſoever is to have that care on behalf of the Church, ſo far as
<pb n="XXXI" facs="tcp:115786:191"/> it may be uſefull to procure the generall good of the Church. And ſurely, the effect and benefit of this diſcipline was invaluable, both to thoſe that paſſed through it, and to the confirmation of the Church. But when a perſon of eminence muſt be made deſperate, by refuſing to readmit him to the Church, (which perhaps was the caſe with S. <hi>Paul</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the inceſtuous perſon at <hi>Corinth,</hi> whom S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> take to be a perſon qualified in that Church, as I have ſhewed in the Apoſtolicall Form of Divine Service, <hi>p.</hi> 119. and ſo, capable to lead a party after him) or, when the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and equality of offenders takes away the benefit of example, and teaches them to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don themſelves, by making a Church of themſelves otherwiſe, (which, if S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> had not ſaid it, we might have gathered to have been the caſe, after the Perſecution of <hi>Decius,</hi> under <hi>Cornelius</hi> and S. <hi>Cyprian)</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt the loſſe of it, is a miſchief nothing comparable to that which would follow, by diſſolving the Unity of the Church. And, if, ſo near the ſource of Chriſtianity, much were abated, what ſhall we think muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, when ſo much water is mingled with the wine of the Goſpel, by admitting good and bad to the mariage of the Lamb? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it my meaning to determine preciſely,
<pb n="XXXII" facs="tcp:115786:192"/> how far the Church may or muſt abate, yet thus much I will inferre for a conſequence, that, as always, there was a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the right of Communion with the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, and inviſible Communion with the Church of the firſt-born, which is the right and title to life everlaſting, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the profeſſion and performance of Chriſtianity; ſo, ſeeing the condition of Communion with the Church is ſtill relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and inlarged more and more, to retain U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in corrupt Chriſtianity, the condition of communion with God remaining always the ſame, the Viſible communion of the Church is always a preſumption of inviſible Chriſtianity, becauſe always neceſſary to it, though not ſufficient alone: and therefore, though not always a reaſonable preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe ſo much difference between the condition of viſible and inviſible, yet always a legall preſumption, effectually qualifying more Chriſtians, as to the Society of the Church. And this is the reaſon of that which I ſay here <hi>p.</hi> that the eſtate of the Church is then moſt happy and moſt pure, when this legall preſumption is moſt reaſonable.</p>
               <p>It is not onely true which I ſay <hi>p.</hi> 30. that the Power of binding and looſing, which the Prieſts and Doctors exerciſed under the Law, that is, of declaring this or that to be
<pb n="XXXIII" facs="tcp:115786:192"/> bound or looſe, that is, unlawfull or lawfull, by the Precepts of the Law, cannot be that which our Lord meaneth, <hi>Mat.</hi> XVIII. 18. when he ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever ye binde on earth—</hi>but, alſo, that the reaſon holdeth not under the Goſpel, to ground a generall Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on correſpondent to the Power in force un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, upon which it may be thought to be ſaid, <hi>Whatſoever ye binde—</hi>For, the reaſon of this Power under the Synagogue, was the matter of poſitive Precepts, not commanded becauſe it was good, but good becauſe it was commanded: Which, where it was not determined by the Law, was to be ſupplied by the Power of the Conſiſtory, eſtabliſhed <hi>Deut.</hi> XVII. 8, 12. the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof being declared by authority de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from thence, made any thing lawfull or unlawfull before God, by virtue of the generall Precept, by which the authority ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted. For which reaſon the Conſiſtory is to offer ſacrifice for the tranſgreſſion of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons, as you ſee here <hi>p.</hi> 158. ſo often as they are led into tranſgreſsion by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory deciding amiſſe. And this reaſon holds under the Goſpel, in regard of matters of Poſitive right, concerning the Society of the Church, not determined by any divine Precept. For, if the Church have determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the matter of them, further then it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<pb n="XXXIV" facs="tcp:115786:193"/> by Divine right, then is that bound or unlawfull which is ſo determined, unleſſe the authority by which it is determined, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that the determination is not to take place. This is the effect of that Legiſlative Power which I challenge for the Church, Chap. IV. from <hi>p.</hi> 170. and concerns onely thoſe poſitive Precepts, which tend to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Society of the Church in Unity. But in thoſe things which concern the ſubſtance of Chriſtianity, becauſe they are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as good, the obligation being more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent then the Conſtitution of the Church, as grounded upon the nature of the ſubject, and the eternall will of God, this power hath no place: And therefore cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be ſignified, by the terms of <hi>binding and looſing,</hi> as borrowed from the language of the Talmud Doctors: But whereas in the Synagogue it was things or caſes, under the Goſpel it is perſons, that are ſaid to be bound or looſe. For, of every caſe queſtionable in point of Chriſtianity, there is no infallible authority given to aſſure all Chriſtians, that, following it, they ſhall always pleaſe God in all actions. But, as it is poſſible to judge of the ſtate of all perſons toward God, upon ſuppoſition of their profeſſion, ſo, there is authority founded in the Church, of binding and looſing, that is, of remitting and retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="XXXV" facs="tcp:115786:193"/> ſins, by admitting to, or excluding from the Church. In fine, this interpretation is inconſequent to the words that went afore, <hi>Let him be unto thee as a Heathen and a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane,</hi> if we take them in <hi>Eraſtus</hi> his ſenſe, that thereby our Lord gives leave, to ſue ſuch, before the Secular Powers of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> as would not ſtand to the ſentence of their own Conſiſtories. For this plainly concerns matter of Intereſſe, not matter of Office, ſeeing it would be very impertinent, ſo to underſtand our Lord, as to command them to be ſued in the Gentiles Courts, that would not ſtand to the ſentence of the Jews Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtories, in matters of Conſcience. But, if we underſtand binding and looſing, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this opinion, to be, declaring this or that to be lawfull or unlawfull before God, then doth it not concern matter of Intereſſe, but matter of Conſcience or Office. Beſides, this interpretation is impertinent to that which follows, <hi>Again, I ſay unto you, if two of you agree upon earth about any thing, to ask it, it ſhall be done for them, by my Father which is in heaven. For, where two or three are aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in my Name, there am I in the midſt of them.</hi> Whereas, the interpretation which here is advanced, of binding and looſing the perſons of them that are admitted to, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the Communion of the Church,
<pb n="XXXVI" facs="tcp:115786:194"/> agreeth with that which went afore; <hi>Let him be to thee as a Heathen and a Publican,</hi> and no leſſe with that which followeth, tending to declare the means of looſing ſuch as ſhould be ſo bound, to wit, the Prayers of the Church, as hath been declared. As for the conceit of <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> that this Precept of our Lord ſhould concern onely the Jews, that lived under the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for an Order to be obſerved in all ages of the Church, it is ſo unreaſonable, that I finde no cauſe to ſpend words in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying it: Onely, be it remembred, that it is contrary to the Order inſtituted by our Lord and his Apoſtles, that the differences of Chriſtians ſhould be caried out of the Church, to be pleaded and heard in the Courts of the Gentiles, according to that which was practiſed afore in the Synagogue, as hath been ſaid. So that this ſenſe of <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> as you ſee by that which follows, it is contrary to the practiſe of the Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>As for the reaſon touched <hi>p.</hi> 43. that the practiſe of the Church before <hi>Conſtantine</hi> is the beſt evidence to ſhew the proper Power and Right of it, it is here opportune to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the diſtinction made afore, and upon it to frame a generall argument againſt both. Which ſhall be this. Either there was a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
<pb n="XXXVII" facs="tcp:115786:194"/> of the Church by right, as we know there was in point of fact, before <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> or there is no ſuch thing to be grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scriptures in point of right, but was onely an uſurpation and impoſture of the Primitive Clergy of the Church. This la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſertion is that which hath been refuted by the premiſes, proving firſt a privilege, or a precept, of communicating in the ſervice of God, given to the community of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſecondly, a condition under which they were admitted to communicate and to be Chriſtians, and continued in the ſame eſtate. But, if there were a Society of the Church before <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> conſtituted by Divine right, then could not the ſame have been diſſolved, but by the ſame Power that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted it from the beginning, neither can it be known to be diſſolved, but by the ſame evidence, by which it appears to have been conſtituted, that is, unleſſe it can be made to appear by the Scriptures, that God ordained it to ſubſiſt, onely till the Romane Empire, and other States and Kingdomes received Chriſtianity, then to be diſſolved into the Power of thoſe States being become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, which I am confident no man will undertake to ſhew out of the Scriptures. If it be ſaid, that it ſubſiſted till <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> not by Divine right, but according to Divine
<pb n="XXXVIII" facs="tcp:115786:195"/> right, that is to ſay, by the Power given the Church by God, of ordering thoſe things which were not determined by any Divine Precept, and yet became determinable, the caſe is the ſame, and the reaſon is where it was: For, if the Church by the Power gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it by God immediately, be enabled to make it ſelf a Society for the better main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and propagation of Chriſtianity, and have executed that Power, by enabling eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of the Church to maintain it ſelf in the Unity of the Whole, by the ſame Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in order to, and dependence upon the Whole, then are all Chriſtians bound by a Divine Precept, of obeying the Governours of the Church, before they can be bound to obey the Secular Powers in Church matters. The one Power being conſtituted by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate revelation and appointment of God, in matters concerning the Society of the Church, the other, conſtituted indeed by the Providence of God executed by man, but enforced, by the Law of Chriſtianity, to be obeyed in all things not excepted by the ſame, whereof this is one. And, if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Chriſtian world can be of any moment, in a matter wherein the Clergy are parties indeed, as they muſt needs be, but muſt challenge their right at their utmoſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, it is not poſſible to give a more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant
<pb n="XXXIX" facs="tcp:115786:195"/> inſtance for the right of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the Church, then the troubles of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> for refuſing to admit <hi>Arrius</hi> to communicate with the Church, being caſt out by the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> the act where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they could not void, the good Emperour being ſeduced to think it neceſſary for the quiet of the Church. And, not onely by this particular, but by all the proceedings of the firſt Chriſtian Emperours in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Church, (who had great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in diſcerning the true Intereſſe of the State and the Church, not onely by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe of thoſe Biſhops which had received it freſher from the ſource, but by ſenſible knowledge of the whole right which they found the Church in poſſeſſion of, when they came to be members of it) it is manifeſt, that they never ſought to bring to effect that which they were perſwaded to be neceſſary for the eſtabliſhment of Chriſtianity, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truly or falſly) as well as for the quiet of their Eſtates and People, by the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate act of their own Soveraign Power, but by the act of thoſe, that were then held able to conclude the Church: Imploying their Secular Power in conſequence to the ſame, to inforce ſuch acts, (though not always va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid to oblige the Church) by temporall Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties,
<pb n="XL" facs="tcp:115786:196"/> on them that refuſed, as enemies to the publick Peace.</p>
               <p>Seeing then that the Church is a Society, Community, Corporation, or ſpirituall Commonwealth, ſubſiſting by the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate revelation and appointment of God, without dependence upon thoſe Chriſtian States wherein it is harboured, as to the Right by which it ſubſiſteth, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherein it communicateth, but depending upon them for the force, which is neceſſarily requiſite, to maintain the whole People of all Chriſtian States, in the communion of their reſpective Churches, and by them of the whole, it followeth of neceſſity, that it is endowed with Rights correſpondent to thoſe, wherein the Soveraignty of States conſiſteth. The Power of the Sword is the principall of thoſe Rights, into which the reſt are reſolved, when they are enforced to have recourſe unto it, for the execution of that which becomes requiſite to make them avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And the Church hath the Sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, which is uſed two manner of ways, as the Sword is, either to ſubdue ſtrangers, or to cut off ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors. Let no man imagine, that any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſon is enabled to propagate the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and conſtitute new Churches, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons newly converted to Chriſtianity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="XLI" facs="tcp:115786:196"/> competent Commiſſion from the Church. To bring men to be Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, is that, which, not onely any of the Clergy, but any Chriſtian may doe, and is to doe, when he findes himſelf able to act towards it, without diſadvantage to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. It is that which the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories informe us, that <hi>Frumentius</hi> and <hi>Aedeſius</hi> did in <hi>India,</hi> and the captive maid in <hi>Iberia,</hi> as well as thoſe of the diſperſion of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in <hi>Phoenice</hi> and <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochia, Acts</hi> XI. 19, 20. But, the authority by which they became a Church, they were to ſeek where it was before, at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as well as thoſe at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Acts</hi> XI. 22. Becauſe, in the Church, the Sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, is depoſited, and truſted with the Church, for the propagation as well as the maintenance of it, and, though all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans muſt needs underſtand themſelves to be under an habituall truſt, or a commiſſion dormant, to perſwade all that they can to the Chriſtianity which they have themſelves, yet, the expreſſe commiſsion of the Church imports further, the exerciſe of that Power which the Society thereof already uſeth, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, that, by virtue of the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, ſhall be brought to be Chriſtians: At leaſt, it may import ſo much, if we ſuppoſe
<pb n="XLII" facs="tcp:115786:197"/> it granted to ſuch purpoſe. The Sword of the Spirit is uſed within the Church, to the puniſhment of malefactors, upon two ſorts of cauſes. For, if any man forfeit his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, either by denying the Faith, upon profeſsion whereof he was admitted to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, or by living contrary to the ſame, the ſame Sword of the Spirit which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces him cut off from God, cuts him off from the Church. And, in regard that it is part of Chriſtianity, to beleeve that God hath ordained a Church, the conſequence whereof is, to oblige all Chriſtians to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themſelves in the Unity of the ſame, which cannot be done by thoſe that refuſe to be concluded by it, in all things not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Gods Law; the ſame Sword of the Spirit that ſubdues all men to be Chriſtians, upon condition to live members of the Church, cuts them off from the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, that will not live within compaſſe of the Unity of it. The Power of the Sword being ſuppoſed in the Church, Juriſdiction follows, which conſiſts not ſo much in judging, as in executing the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Not that there is any ſuch thing as Juriſdiction, (ſuch as the Civile Laws of the Romanes, and all other People underſtand, which proceeds by conſtraint of outward force) in the Church: But, becauſe the
<pb n="XLIII" facs="tcp:115786:197"/> Church being conſtituted of ſuch as deſire to continue Chriſtians, upon ſuppoſition of this will to continue a Chriſtian, he may be ſaid to be conſtrained to hear the Church, that cannot communicate with the Church, unleſſe he doe ſo as it requires. Upon the ſame ground ſubſiſts the Right of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, anſwerable to that part of Soveraignty in States, which conſiſts in creation of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and Officers, (for it is, without doubt, beſide the intent of the Romane Laws, to call the Soveraign a Magiſtrate, Magiſtrates being generally Miniſters of the Soveraign) which creates a particular Power over the Clergy, by the Juriſdiction of the Church. For, in regard that (as it hath been ſaid on divers occaſions in this Diſcourſe) the Clergy is promoted, upon ſuppoſition of ſome degree of proficience in Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, over and above that, upon ſuppoſition whereof, men are admitted to be only Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, it followeth not, that thoſe, who by their converſation render themſelves unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of that degree which they hold in the Clergy, doe, by the ſame means, render themſelves unworthy of the Communion of the Church. Therefore, the puniſhment of a Clergy man may be competent, by onely voiding his degree, when another Chriſtian cannot be competently puniſhed, but by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="XLIV" facs="tcp:115786:198"/> him from the Church. Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the Power of Ordaining, as well as cenſuring perſons Ordained, is grounded upon the Power of the Keys, as giving or taking away, not the communion of the Church, but a degree and quality above it, which ſuppoſeth it. Again, upon the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Society of the Church, follows the Power of making Canons, Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Ordinances, obliging the reſpective body thereof, correſpondent to the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power of Kingdomes and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, wherein the juſtice of them moſt appears, though the ſtrength of them is more ſeen, in the Power of the Sword, which gives all Laws force. And ſo, it is no more inconvenience, to all theſe Canons the Laws of the Church, then it is, to call the Power of Excommunication the ſpirituall Sword of the Church. Neither is it any more for the Church, to have this Power, then that which States ordinarily allow the meaneſt Corporations which they Privilege, to wit, to give Laws to their own Bodies, for the maintenance and execution of the Laws, originally given them by thoſe who are enabled to inſtitute them. In fine, in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence to the Exchequer of a State, is the Title that God hath given his Church to the Oblations of the Faithfull, their Firſt-fruits,
<pb n="XLV" facs="tcp:115786:198"/> and Tithes: The right whereof he hath endowed the Church with, leaving the ſeizure, to the voluntary tender of thoſe, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he calleth to be voluntary Chriſtians. And thus, and by this correſpondence with a State, the parts of Eccleſiaſticall Power are more clearly and more intelligibly diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, in my opinion, then by the ordinary terms of Juriſdiction and Order. For firſt, theſe terms, being introduced by the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts and School Doctors, ſeem to preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a coactive Juriſdiction in the Church, upon the conſtitution, and originall Title of the Church, ſuch as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> challenges, and the Decretall Epiſtles of the Popes preſuppoſe, whereby they challenge to themſelves that Power by Divine Right, which, by the ſufferance of Princes and States, they did exerciſe, (intangling the Schools of Divines with as inextricable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, to make it good, as Chriſtian States with commotions, to ſhake off the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences thereof) meerly for neglect of the principle here preſuppoſed, that Chriſtianity importeth no right of this world, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the coactive Power of the State remains where it was before it. Secondly, it ſeemeth, that the Power of Order and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction are not contradiſtinct but ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, the Power of Order being the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="XLVI" facs="tcp:115786:199"/> and conſequence of the Power of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, if it be rightly underſtood: For, by the ſame reaſon which proveth here, <hi>p.</hi> 199 that the power of conſecrating the Euchariſt belongeth to Presbyters, upon the Power of the Keys, and that all Benedictions with Impoſition of Hands, whether in Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, Ordination, Penance, Mariage, or whatſoever elſe, are marks of that Power, which alloweth thoſe acts which are bleſſed, to be done in the Church, as you have it here <hi>p.</hi> 23. by the ſame reaſon it follows, that the miniſtery of all Ordinances of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited with the Church, is a mark of that ſuperiority, which, thoſe that miniſter the ſame have in the Church. And therefore, if the Power of Order be in reſpect of Chriſts own Body, as ordinarily they deſcribe it, it proceeds from the Power over his myſticall Body, which is that of Juriſdiction as they make it. Or if, as others will have it, the Power of Order conſiſts in the miniſtery of ſuch divine Ordinances, as are the means to procure and increaſe Gods grace, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom they are miniſterd; the ſame reaſon takes place: Becauſe they are not to be miniſtred, but by them whom the Church truſteth to do it, to that true intent which it teacheth. Wherefore, it ſeemeth, that the term of Juriſdiction ought to expreſſe the
<pb n="XLVII" facs="tcp:115786:199"/> common ſource of all Eccleſiaſticall Power, which it doth not, becauſe that, as Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is but a part of Soveraignty in a State, ſo the Power from which the metaphoricall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Church floweth, (which I conceive, cannot be better expreſſed, then by calling it the Power of the Keys, as the Goſpel hath done) produceth other bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Eccleſiaſticall Power, correſpondent to other parts of Soveraignty in a State, as hereby you have ſeen.</p>

               <p>HAving thus determined whereupon the Power of the Keys is founded, and wherein it conſiſteth, it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to proceed and declare what perſons it is truſted with: For, ſeeing the perſons of whom Chriſtian States conſiſt, are the ſame, of whom the Churches, or parts of the whole Church that are contained in thoſe States, conſiſt, if there be no proviſion of Gods Law, tying the Right of managing this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the productions and branches there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to ſome qualities conſequent to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Church, it will neceſſarily fall as an eſcheat to the State, and we ſhall be ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to grant it Power to conferre thoſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="XLVIII" facs="tcp:115786:200"/> by which it is managed, and all this will be truly ſaid to no purpoſe. Here, in the firſt place, I muſt inſiſt upon a point, the truth whereof, the Presbyteries and Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have equally divided between them, and left it entire to the Church. For, thoſe of the Congregations, finding, that the deſign of the Presbyteries, had ordered a Presbytery for the government of every Congregation that aſſembles together for the common ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, had reaſon to inferre, that all thoſe Presbyteries ought to be endowed with the Power of the Keys, as to their own Bodies. To which, aſſuming another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that the chief Power in every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation was that of the People, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that all Congregations are independent and abſolute, not to be concluded by any Church, or Synod repreſentative of Churches, above themſelves. On the other ſide, the Presbyterians, finding, that no Unity can be preſerved without dependence, and deſiring to preſerve Unity among themſelves, though not with the Church, have deſigned the Power of the Keys, as to the act of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, to reſt in Repreſentatives of the Presbyteries of Congregations, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, they call by the ſame name of Presbyteries, or Claſſes, the ſame being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Synods of Presbyteries, and thoſe to
<pb n="XLIX" facs="tcp:115786:200"/> Nationall Aſſemblies. Whereas, there is never any mention, in all the Scriptures, of any Presbytery, or Company, College, or Bench of Presbyters, as likewiſe there is no mention of any Church, but in a City: No mention of more Churches then one in the greateſt City, and the moſt populous, for number of Chriſtians, that is mentioned in all the Scriptures: Though no common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can queſtion, but there were more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, conſidering that it cannot be thought, that all the Chriſtians, contained in the greateſt and moſt Chriſtian of all thoſe Cities, could aſſemble together at once for the common ſervice of God. Upon theſe premiſes it is neceſſary to inferre, that the Apoſtles Order was that, which we ſee was the Rule of their practice, that the ſeverall Bodies of thoſe that ſhould be converted to Chriſtianity, within ſeverall Cities and the Territories thereof, ſhould conſtitute ſeverall Churches, to be governed by the ſeverall Presbyteries thereof, conſtituted and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as ſhall be declared in the conſequences. Which being eſtabliſhed, it will not be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to inferre, that the Power of the Keys, and the conſequences thereof, are depoſited in the ſaid Churches, that is, truſted with them that are endowed with the Power of Governing thoſe Churches. To which, if
<pb n="L" facs="tcp:115786:201"/> you adde this, that the Churches of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Cities, were to depend upon the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Mother Cities, upon which particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Cities depended for the civile Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; you have a reaſon and Rule of the whole frame of Church Government de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by the Apoſtles, as generall as could be given to a Society, that was to conſiſt of ſeverall Nations and Soveraignties without limits, but not more generall, then the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall conſtitution of the whole Church, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from their deſign, will evidence to be agreeable to thoſe impreſſions and marks of it, which are here produced out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
               <p>This Poſition is liable to an Objection, from thoſe, which the ancient Canons of the Greekiſh Councels call <hi>Chorepiſcopi,</hi> which we may tranſlate <hi>Country Biſhops,</hi> becauſe the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> properly ſignifieth <hi>the Country,</hi> in oppoſition to, or in difference from the City. For, if Churches conſtituted in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, have their ſeverall Presbyteries, the Heads whereof being Biſhops, are, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, Governors in chief of their reſpective Churches, how are Biſhops conſtituted in the Country, that is, in any of the chief Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages under any City? For, by this means, either we have a Church in a Village, or a Biſhop without a Church, and ſo, the practiſe
<pb n="LI" facs="tcp:115786:201"/> of the Church, not to be reconciled with that which I make the deſign of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, if either be true. The anſwer to this, in generall, muſt come from that, which you have here afterwards, <hi>p.</hi> 62. that the Rule is as generally expreſſed in theſe terms, as any Rule generall to thoſe caſes that may fall out ſo divers. For, the generall intent and reaſon of it is, to preſerve the Unity of the Whole Church, by the ſubordination and dependence of the parts thereof, to and from other parts, and ſo the Whole. If ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular proviſion prove neceſſary ſome time and place, to attain this end, it is not to be thought that the generall Rule holds not therefore. For the particular here in hand, one thing I conceive may be queſtionable in point of Fact, and matter of Hiſtoricall Truth, concerning theſe Country Biſhops, which the Canons quoted <hi>p.</hi> 146. ſpeak of. For, in the beginning of the XI Canon of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> it is ſaid, that they received <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Ordination of Biſhops; In the end of it, it is provided that they be Ordained by the Biſhop of the City to whom they are ſubject. The firſt clauſe ſeems to intimate, that they have the ſame Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with other Biſhops, which is by the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of the Province, or thoſe that repreſent the ſame: Beſides that, we finde, by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
<pb n="LII" facs="tcp:115786:202"/> of the Councels, that they were called to Councels, as if they received their truſt immediately from the Synods of their Provinces. By the ſecond clauſe, it ſeems they receive their authority immediately from the Biſhop of the Province, whereupon they are called <hi>Vicarii Epiſcoporum,</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Deputies, as you ſee in the place afore named. What my judgement is in this point you may have ſeen before, <hi>p.</hi> 146. neither do I ſee cauſe to repent me of it. For, howſoever they were Ordained, and from whomſoever they received their truſt, it is manifeſt by the Canons of <hi>Ancyra</hi> and <hi>Laodicea</hi> there quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they received it upon ſuch terms as to be ſubordinate to the Biſhop of the City, which otherwiſe Biſhops were not, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the Synod of the Province, and the Biſhop of the Mother City. Neither is it contrary to the ground of that generall Rule which I maintain, that it ſhould be within the Power of the Church, contained in any Province, (that is to ſay, the Synod of the ſame) to Ordain, that, (in regard ſome Village under ſome City of that Province, grew conſiderable for the extent of it, and the multitude of Chriſtian ſouls contained in it) therefore it ſhould have a Biſhop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Biſhop of the City. Alway provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the dependence of Churches might
<pb n="LIII" facs="tcp:115786:202"/> be preſerved, wherein the Unity of the whole conſiſted. But it is manifeſt, that this depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence might be maintained two ſeverall ways, ſuppoſing a Biſhop to be conſtituted in a Village: Firſt, Ordaining him to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to the Biſhop of the City: Which is the caſe of thoſe whom we ſpeak of, whoſe Power is tied up, as you have ſeen, by the ſaid Canons of <hi>Ancyra</hi> and <hi>Laodicea.</hi> But, ſhould they be left free from all dependence on the City Biſhop, then were they abſolute Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and their Churches, though in Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and therefore leſſe; yet, for their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Power and right, the ſame with other Churches conſtituted in Cities: Which ſeems to be the caſe of the Churches of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick,</hi> where Biſhops were ſo plentifull, that every good Village muſt needs be the Seat of an Epiſcopall Church. Neither doth this deſtroy the Rule which I maintain, that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Churches were originally converti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but argues, that Villages, in ſome Countries, had that privilege, which, in others, was proper to Cities.</p>
               <p>To that which is ſaid, <hi>p.</hi> 53. of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Propheſies, and between A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Prophets, I adde this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That the Apoſtles of our Lord were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily Prophets, becauſe of the promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, to lead them into all truth,
<pb n="LIV" facs="tcp:115786:203"/> to remember them of our Lords Doctrine, and to make them underſtand the Scriptures, all which are contained in the thing ſignified by this word Propheſie, though the originall thereof import onely foretelling things to come, as it is manifeſt by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XIV. But all Prophets are not neceſſarily Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that is, ſent by God to declare their Commiſſion to his people, or to charge them with thoſe things which God revealed to themſelves. I grant, that the Prophets under the Old Teſtament were ſuch, by reaſon of that Law by which God appointeth them to be obeyed, and therefore giveth a Rule, how to diſcern between true and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>Deut.</hi> XVIII. 18. And hereupon it is, that their writings are the Word of God, and, that Propheſie is ſaid to have failed, after thoſe, whoſe Writings we have. Not, that we are bound to disbeleeve <hi>Joſephus,</hi> when he relates, of <hi>John Hyrcanus</hi> the Prince of the Nation, and others, that they foreſaw things to come; (to ſay nothing of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> the Bleſſed Virgin and <hi>Zachary,</hi> becauſe the light which they had, may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the dawning of that day that was to come under the Goſpel) but becauſe they were not ſent with means to make evidence of their Commiſſion, and ſo, to charge the people of God. As, at the preſent, though
<pb n="LV" facs="tcp:115786:203"/> God may grant revelations, yet no obligation upon the Church follows, becauſe no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion can be made to appear. Whereby we may meaſure the difference between the Prophets of the Old Teſtament, and the Prophets which we reade of in the Churches of the New. Thoſe, having Commiſſions to the people in Covenant with God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his pleaſure, in the interpretation, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, diſpenſation of the ſame, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Gods poſitive Law, in as much as God, by them, might abate it ſome time, and ſome where, as by <hi>Elias</hi> in Mount <hi>Carmell.</hi> Theſe, we doe not finde that they had to doe beyond the Churches whereof they were, to evidence the preſence of God in the Church by his Graces, to inform them of things to come, to inſtruct their own Churches, but, always ſuppoſing the conſtitution of the Church, and the Laws whereby they were ſetled by the Apoſtles. And therefore, if the Prophets of the Old Teſtament were under the Conſiſtory, to be judged by them, as I have ſaid here, <hi>p.</hi> 104. much more were the Prophets of the New Teſtament ſubject to the Apoſtles, when as, by like reaſon, they were to be ſubject to the Government of their own Churches, ſeeing there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of any privilege for them, againſt the common obligation of obedience to the
<pb n="LVI" facs="tcp:115786:204"/> ſame. Whereupon, the Montaniſts, who made a Schiſm upon preſumption of ſome inſtructions they had from their ſuppoſed Prophets, were not onely abuſed in point of Fact, to take them for Prophets which were not, but were guilty of Schiſm in point of Right, becauſe God had given no Power to thoſe, whom he granted thoſe Graces to under the Goſpel, againſt the ordinary go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Church.</p>
               <p>I will adde here, to that which you finde, of the State of the Jews at <hi>Alexandria, p.</hi> 56. a remarkable paſſage of an Edict of <hi>Claudius</hi> in favour of the Jews, recorded by <hi>Joſephus, Antiqu.</hi> XIX. 4. where, having ſaid, that he had underſtood, that the Romane Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, from the taking in of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> had always maintained the Jews in their Rights, he adds, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>And, that, when the Prince of the Jews Nation was dead, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus did not forbid them to make Princes, but would have all ſubject to him, continuing in their own cuſtomes, and not conſtrained to tranſgreſſe the Religion of their Fathers.</hi> Which, if we compare with the words of <hi>Philo adverſus Flaccum,</hi> where he affirms,
<pb n="LVII" facs="tcp:115786:204"/> that the Conſiſtory of the Jews at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> was eſtabliſhed or confirmed by <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> it will appear, that the Jews had the ſame Government in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and <hi>Babylonia,</hi> to wit, by a Head of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a Conſiſtory. <hi>Zorobabel</hi> was their Prince when they firſt returned from the Captivity; but, as the little Chronicle of the Jews relates, he afterwards left <hi>Judaea,</hi> and returned into <hi>Babylonia,</hi> where his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity continued Heads of the Captives, (as they are called by <hi>Joſephus</hi>

Which, how it can ſtand with the relation of the Scriptures, before the deſtruction of the Temple, I doe not ſo well underſtand. But, when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, by the kindneſſe of King <hi>Agrippa</hi> to his Nation, and his love to the Law, as it ſeems moſt probable, they took up their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence at <hi>Tiberias,</hi> it ſeems there is not much doubt to be made, that, from thenceforth, thoſe of this ſtock continued Patriarchs, and the Conſiſtory there under them, till the times of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and the Emperours,

               <p>There is, in the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, a conſideration very proper to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the reaſon why <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was afterwards the ſecond in rank after <hi>Rome,</hi> which is here touched <hi>p.</hi> 59. And it is that of the power of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> the City of his Biſhoprick. For, becauſe, during the time of <hi>Diocletian, Nicomedia</hi> was, as it were, the Seat of the Empire, he having made it his main Reſidence, with an intent to have it ſo continue; thereupon, ſaith the Hiſtory, <hi>Euſebius,</hi> growing to great eminence in the Church, undertook the ſupport of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> againſt <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> If, therefore, the Biſhop of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſuch authority in the Church, by the ambulatory reſidence of the Empire there, ſince the time of <hi>Diocletian,</hi> well might the preeminence ſettle at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had fixed the Seat of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire there, and that, by the virtue of the Rule given by the Apoſtles, though the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thereof come after the act of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi>

               <p> To that which I have ſaid, from <hi>p.</hi> 62. of the great difference that is to be found in the execution of the Apoſtles Rule, that Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſhould be planted in Cities, or in the greateſt Reſidences, in ſeverall Counties, that is to be added, which <hi>Sozomenus, Eccleſ. Hiſt.</hi> VI. 20. hath recorded, concerning that Province which he cals <hi>Scythia,</hi> the Romanes <hi>Moeſia Inferior,</hi> in which, at the time of the Emperour <hi>Valens,</hi> there was but one Biſhop, of the Mother City <hi>Tomi,</hi> the place of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> baniſhment; For, this is the ſame caſe, with that which is related by <hi>Eutychius,</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> before <hi>Demetrius</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> that there was no more Biſhops in it beſides that one, the ſame which <hi>Godignus</hi> relates of the <hi>Abaſſines,</hi> that there is, to this day, but one Biſhop in all that Dominion, as you have it here <hi>p.</hi> 64.</p>
               <p>To all the reaſons here produced for the Dependence of Churches, adde the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Unity of the Church, how it was commanded by God in point of right, and how provided, and maintained, in point of Fact, by the Church. For, if the Church be a Viſible Society, commanded to live in Unity, then is the Unity thereof commanded to be Viſible: That is, it is commanded, that Chriſtians preſerve Unity with all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, not onely in Faith and Love, inwardly,
<pb n="LXII" facs="tcp:115786:207"/> in the minde, but alſo in the outward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of all thoſe Ordinances, wherein God hath appointed his Service, under the Goſpel, to conſiſt. And this is manifeſt by the words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to continue in Unity, becauſe they have <hi>one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one God and Father of All, Eph.</hi> IV. 4. For if theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and reaſons were proper to the Church of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> then might it very well be thought, that Chriſtians are obliged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, onely to live in Unity, with thoſe of the ſame Church; But, ſince they are common to all Chriſtians of all Churches never ſo remote, it followeth, that the Precept of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the Unity of the Church, obligeth all Chriſtians viſibly to communicate with all Chriſtians. By which reaſon, the ſame may be proved, by all or moſt of thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, which recommend, or which onely mention the Unity of the Church. But it is moſt peremptorily proved by that which hath been produced in the firſt Chapter, to ſhew the condition upon which all men are to be admitted to the Communion of the Church, which is, the Profeſſion of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. For, ſeeing that is one and the ſame, in all parts and Climates of the World, as introduced by the ſame Power, and derived from the ſame Fountain, it follows, that
<pb n="LXIII" facs="tcp:115786:207"/> no Church hath any further to enquire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any mans right of communicating with the Church, but whether his Profeſſion be allowed by his own Church, and whether that hold Communion with the Whole. And truly, becauſe it is the ſame condition which entitles all men to the Communion of the Church all over the world, that is, to Profeſſe the ſubſtance of Chriſtianity, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Churches are to procure, that there be nothing to hinder this Communion, when that condition is performed, and every perſon of thoſe Churches, in their ſeverall qualities, that nothing elſe be demanded. But, when ſome Churches, or ſome parts of one and the ſame Church, demand for the condition of communicating with others, ſomething more then was appointed for the condition of it from the beginning, ſeparation and Schiſm follows, the cauſe whereof is commonly doubtfull, becauſe it appears not, how farre ſeverall Churches, or parts of the ſame, are to yeeld to the acts of others, which would conclude the whole if they ſhould yeeld, when it appears not, how the matter of them agrees with that condition of Communion with the Church, that was delivered from the beginning. But, when both ſides charge the blame on the contrary party, they ſhew, that they are both agreed, that the blame
<pb n="LXIV" facs="tcp:115786:208"/> muſt lie on one ſide, and therefore, that the unity of the Church is ſuch as hath been ſaid, becauſe, Schiſm in the Church, no more then War in civile Society, can be juſt on both ſides. Now, it is very manifeſt, that, in the Primitive Church, this unity was actuated by intercourſe of letters from Church to Church, begun firſt, and eſtabliſhed by the Apoſtles themſelves, whoſe writings are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all Epiſtles; For, by their Epiſtles, as the matter of Chriſtianity is more and more declared, ſo, the intercourſe and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Church is preſerved, in as much as it is manifeſt, that their Epiſtles require nothing of the Churches to which, but the ſame which they require of the Churches from which they write, ſo that there muſt needs be correſpondence between all that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Apoſtles holding correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. The ſame courſe was continued, not onely by the Epiſtles of the Primitive Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, which are a great part of their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings ſtill remaining, but, a great deal more, by the intercourſe of their <hi>Formatae,</hi> or let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of mark, which, every Chriſtian that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled into a ſtrange Country taking with him from his own Church, found, not onely the Communion of the Church open to him whereſoever he came, but alſo, that aſſiſtance in his affairs, which Chriſtians are to expect
<pb n="LXV" facs="tcp:115786:208"/> from the charity of Chriſtians. And, of this kinde, the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes</hi> may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, becauſe of the recommendation of <hi>Phoebe,</hi> XVI. 2. as of a Deaconeſſe in the Church of <hi>Cenchreae</hi> near <hi>Corinth.</hi> The effect of this courſe is viſible in all the proceedings of the Primitive Church, whereof we have ſome memorable inſtances here afore rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. When, by the reſult of a Councell, ſuch or ſuch Biſhops are removed from their Churches, it is ordinarily ſignified to other Churches, by the letters of the Councell, with this warning, That none of them, from thenceforth, write to the perſons ſo ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, nor receive letters from them as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. <hi>Marcion,</hi> being put out of his Fathers Church of <hi>Pontus,</hi> is refuſed to be admitted to Communion at <hi>Rome,</hi> leſt the unity of the Church ſhould be diſſolved, if the act of a Church ſo far diſtant, ſhould not be made good by that of <hi>Rome,</hi> being an act in the Power of that Church to doe. Therefore, upon the doing of the act, it was to be ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that it might be known what was to be done. The Excommunication of <hi>Androni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> is, by <hi>Syneſius</hi> his eight and fiftieth Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, ſignified to the Churches, with this proteſtation, That if any Church admitted him, without giving ſatisfaction to theirs, it would thereby cauſe Schiſm, and diſſolve
<pb n="LXVI" facs="tcp:115786:209"/> the unity of the Church. Infinite more might be produced to this purpoſe; for, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it is, that all Biſhops, are, many times, in the Primitive Records of the Church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to have a charge of the whole Church, becauſe of their intereſſe to give adviſe, and thereby, to concur in the ſetling of all affairs of other Churches, that might conduce to the quiet or unquietneſſe of the Whole: Which, as it was ſolemnely done by the Aſſemblies of Synods, ſo, it was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day done by this intercourſe, which, in time of Perſecution, ſupplied the uſe of them, to better effect then they were found to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in time of peace. And this ſeems to me a peremptory argument againſt the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, becauſe this intercourſe was a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of daily neceſſity, whereas, by the deſign of the Presbyteries, there is no ſtanding Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to which the Church can have recourſe, for aſſiſtance, in the ordinary occaſions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of which concern other parts, but the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries of Congregations, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves condemne as uncapable to deal in ſuch matters, when they give them not power to excommunicate. Therefore, it is of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that, in the greateſt reſidences of the World, thoſe Bodies of Churches ſhould be always ſtanding, to which the Church might have daily reſort, either to receive or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
<pb n="LXVII" facs="tcp:115786:209"/> adviſe, judgement, ſentence, and whatſoever was to paſſe for the maintenance of unity in the exerciſe of Chriſtianity, ſo that, what there ſhould be received, might by conſequence, be preſumed, to be received by all Chriſtians contained under the ſame, not having any pretenſe to oppoſe ſuch a conſent as they were prejudiced with. And thus, upon the proof of the inſtitution of Churches in Cities, it follows, that the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Keys, and all the productions and branches of the ſame, as to their reſpective Bodies, in concurrence with other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of like Rank, and dependence on thoſe of higher, is, by conſequence, depoſited with the ſame.</p>
               <p>To conceive aright of the correſpondence between the Conſtitution of the Church and the Synagogue, which, it is manifeſt, our Lord himſelf pointed at, in chooſing XII A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and LXX Diſciples, as it is touched here <hi>p.</hi> 72. we are to deduce it from the vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Goſpel within the Law, and the diſcovering of the New Teſtament, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the vail of the Old. By reaſon whereof, the Church is the ſpirituall <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as the Synagogue was <hi>Iſrael</hi> according to the fleſh, no otherwiſe then the Goſpel is the Law ſpiritually underſtood: A thing ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by all the paſſages of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="LXVIII" facs="tcp:115786:210"/> produced, expounded, and applied, not onely by the Apoſtles, but by our Lord himſelf in the New, that he ſhall, of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, doe great wrong to Chriſtianity, that ſhall take in hand to maintain it againſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm, without drawing this ground into conſequence. Now it is manifeſt, that the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> being made a free People, by the act of God, bringing them out of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and entitling them to the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, upon the Covenant of the Law, had <hi>Moſes,</hi> not onely for their Prophet and chief Prieſt, (for by him <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Succeſſors are put in poſſeſſion of the Prieſthood, and the Tabernacle it ſelf, and all the pertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof made and conſecrated) but alſo for their King, their Lawgiver, their Judge, and Commander in Chief of their forces un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, if not rather God by <hi>Moſes.</hi> For, after the deceaſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> we ſee, that, either God, by ſome extraordinary immediate ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of his will and pleaſure, ſtirred up ſome man to be in his ſtead for the time, or, if there were none ſuch, then he took upon him to rule their proceedings himſelf, in as much as, by anſwering their demands by <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> he directed them what to doe, and what courſes to follow, in the publick affairs, that concerned the State of that People. Whereupon, when they requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="LXIX" facs="tcp:115786:210"/> 
                  <hi>Samuel</hi> to make them a King, he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that it was not <hi>Samuel,</hi> but himſelf, whom they had rejected, becauſe they had rejected him whom God had immediately given them, in his own ſtead, ſo that, by his naturall death, the Power returned to God as at the beginning. Under <hi>Moſes,</hi> the XII Heads of the Tribes, Repreſentatives of the XII Patriarchs, commanded the <hi>Militia</hi> of their reſpective Tribes, divided into Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, Hundreds, Fifties, and Tens, which diviſion, by divers paſſages of the Scriptures, appears to have continued to after ages, without doubt, for no other reaſon, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lot of every Tribe was divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them according to the ſame. And the chief of theſe diviſions are they, whom <hi>Moſes,</hi> upon <hi>Jethroes</hi> adviſe, aſſumed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to judge the cauſes of leſſe moment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the greater to him, who, over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that charge, was to goe between the people and God, in all things which he ſhould pleaſe immediately to determine, as you may ſee by the Text of <hi>Exodus</hi> XIX. 16, 19, 20. This Office it is, which, he aſſumed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards LXX of the Elders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him in, which, by the Law, ſo often quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, of <hi>Deut.</hi> XVII. 8—are, afterwards, made a ſtanding Court, reſident at the place of the Tabernacle, to judge the laſt reſult of
<pb n="LXX" facs="tcp:115786:211"/> all cauſes concerning the Law, and to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all matter of Right not determined by the letter of the ſame. So that, by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the judgement of inferiour cauſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing upon the Laws given by God, reſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth unto the inferiour Conſiſtories of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Cities, conſtituted by the Law of <hi>Deut.</hi> XVI. 18. though perhaps, partly, in the Hands of thoſe Captains, before the Laws were altogether provided or put in force, which dependeth much on the poſſeſſion of the Land of Promiſe. This is the reaſon, that thoſe of the High Conſiſtory are called the Elders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but thoſe of other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtories, barely Elders, or the Elders of ſuch or ſuch a City, as <hi>Deut.</hi> XXII. 2, 3. <hi>Let thy Elders goe forth,</hi> and, <hi>let the Elders of the next City take—Thy Elders,</hi> that is, <hi>the Elders of Iſrael:</hi> So thoſe of the Great Conſiſtory are ordinarily called in the Goſpel, as alſo the <hi>Scribes of the People,</hi> and <hi>thy Scribes,</hi> is uſed there, for thoſe of the High Conſiſtory, whereas the bare name of Scribes extended far further, to other manner of perſons. As alſo, the bare name of <hi>Rulers,</hi> and that of <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the People of Iſrael,</hi> are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood with the like difference. Now, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſiſts the correſpondence between the Order of the Church, and this of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue? The King of the Church, without
<pb n="LXXI" facs="tcp:115786:211"/> doubt, is our Lord Chriſt alone, who hath abſolute Power over it, and becauſe he is in heaven, his <hi>Militia</hi> is alſo heavenly, even <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels, that fight for the Church, againſt the Devil and his Angels, as the XII Standards of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is camped with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Tabernacle, which is the Church, containing all Chriſtians. But the XII Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and LXX Diſciples, muſt needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to hold correſpondence with the XII Heads of the Tribes and LXX Elders. And the whole reaſon and ground of this correſpondence, to conſiſt in the whole Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of governing the ſpirituall <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, which is his Church, to remain in their hands, as the Rulers, and as the Counſell thereof, while it was altogether in one Body, from thence to be propagated into the like, when it came to be divided into ſeverall Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, by the founding of ſeverall Churches, as you have ſeen that it was among the Jews, in <hi>Paleſtine, Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>Babylonia.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as there can no queſtion be made, that the Jews, by virtue of Gods Law, created themſelves that Government which they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed in their diſperſions, by ſufferance of their Soveraigns, according to the form deſigned by the Law, by a Conſiſtory, in the Mother Cities of their diſperſions, with infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Conſiſtories, where the number of Jews
<pb n="LXXII" facs="tcp:115786:212"/> was ſo great as to require a form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: No more can it be doubted, that, when Churches were founded in the greateſt Reſidences, concurring with Churches foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the like, and depending on thoſe of the Mother Cities, for the maintenance of Unity in the Whole, all this, though execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by humane diſcretion, was done by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Rule deſigned by the Apoſtles. And, as all <hi>Iſrael</hi> had no power to adde or take from the Law, yet was to be concluded, in that which the Law had not determined, by the Conſiſtory, ſo, all the Church, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Power to make any thing of divine Right that was not ſo from the beginning, hath Power to determine, what the Church ſhall either do, or acknowledge, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Unity in it ſelf, in all matters not determined by Divine Right. As for the Prieſts Office, from which moſt men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to derive the preeminences of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, although it were manifeſtly peculiar to <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh, and to ceaſe with the ſame, ſeeing the Church hath no other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice but that one of Chriſt upon the Croſſe, not repeated, but repreſented conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, by the Prayers of the Church, at the celebration of the Euchariſt, as the reaſon which muſt make all thoſe Prayers effectuall by the peculiar Covenant of Chriſtianity, it
<pb n="LXXIII" facs="tcp:115786:212"/> follows, that thoſe that are intruſted with the Government and maintenance of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, are, by conſequence, intruſted with the offering of this Sacrifice, and of theſe Prayers of the Church unto God, by the ſame reaſon, for the which, I ſaid afore, that the Conſecration of the Euchariſt floweth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Power of the Keys: So that, whether they be called Elders or Prieſts, they have both denominations from the quality of Presbyters. Seeing then, that the Apoſtles are, by their Commiſſion, the XII Patriarchs of the ſpirituall <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, which is his Church, and ſo, the Chief Governours of the ſame, let not the Presbyterians imagine, that they can degrade them to the rank of their buckram Elders, or ſhew us, what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, mentioned in the Scriptures, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles acted as Apoſtles, and what, as El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, (as, that they concurred in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the common quality of Elders) unleſſe they can produce other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of other Apoſtles, ſuperiour to theſe, that appoint it: All theſe recording the acts of chief Governours of the whole Church, as founders of it by their Originall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and Lawgivers to it, in whatſoever our Lord had not determined afore. And, though their proceedings, are throughout, a pattern of meekneſſe and condeſcenſion to
<pb n="LXXIV" facs="tcp:115786:213"/> all ranks in the Church, uſing their Power, with that humility which our Lord had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to his Chief Diſciples, to give ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to all, of the reaſonableneſſe of their proceedings, (becauſe there was then juſt preſumption, that others would uſe the like reverence to them, in receiving ſatisfaction, as they in tendring it) yet, by S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> we ſee, how far it reached, when any pretenſe oppoſed it ſelf againſt it. Suppoſe now, for the purpoſe, that <hi>Barnabas</hi> was one of the LXX, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> affirms, ſhall we indure it to be affirmed, that, when he is ſent by the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Antiochia, Acts</hi> XI. 20. he is ſent by the appointment of certain of the people, who had a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from our Lord, before they were Chriſtians, even for the founding of that Church, wherein, they who are thought to ſend then, received Chriſtianity? Surely, the Commiſſion of our Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> XXVIII. 18—extendeth to the LXX, as well as to the XII, though in dependence on them, as the XII Princes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And therefore, as it is manifeſt, that <hi>Barnabas</hi> was ſent to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochia,</hi> becauſe thoſe that had made Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans at <hi>Antiochia,</hi> had not power to found a Church there, by ordering their Aſſemblies, which <hi>Barnabas</hi> is ſaid there to have done, ſo is it manifeſt, that he could not receive this
<pb n="LXXV" facs="tcp:115786:213"/> power from the people of the Church at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> (which may better challenge it then any Lay Elders, whoſe Title muſt come from the People, as I have ſhewed Chap III. and will ſhew by Gods help by and by, more at large) but, that he muſt be underſtood to be ſent by the Church, becauſe by the XII, and by the LXX, with the conſent and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Clergy and People. And ſent, ſo to order a new plantation of the ſpirituall <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that, notwithſtanding, one of thoſe that ſent him, taking the charge afterwards into his own hands, might become Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of that Tribe, which ſhould be planted in and under that City: As alſo, <hi>Barnabas</hi> himſelf to become the Head of another plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> (who by virtue of the Power received by <hi>Barnabas</hi> at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> was by him aſſumed to his aſſiſtance) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards acknowledged to be called by God into the rank of the XII, to become a Patriarch of thoſe plantations, which recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Chriſtianity by his means: And thus, it is no inconvenience which ſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have incurred, by affirming, that the XII have the rank of Biſhops, and the LXX of Presbyters, if we refer them to the whole Church, not to any particular Church, but onely by correſpondence: For ſo were the XII Patriarchs to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as
<pb n="LXXVI" facs="tcp:115786:214"/> the LXX were Presbyters and Elders to the ſame, as I ſaid of the Conſiſtory: Every part of the Church planted in and under any City, having nevertheleſſe, according to one and the ſame form, a Ruler of a Biſhop, and a Councell of Presbyters. And yet is it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inconvenient, in another regard, that the Councell of <hi>Neocaeſarea, Can.</hi> XIII. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares Country Biſhops to the LXX, the City Biſhops being by correſpondence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently compared to the XII: Becauſe, on the one ſide thoſe Country Biſhops were to be ſubordinate to the Biſhops of their Cities, as the LXX were to the XII: On the other ſide, the LXX, being anſwerable to the LXX Elders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> muſt needs be underſtood, to be of a higher quality then common Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.</p>

               <p>THat it is no new reaſon that here is rendred, <hi>p.</hi> 91. why the name of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopus,</hi> under the Apoſtles, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to thoſe, that are ſince diſtinctly called Biſhops and Presbyters, may appear by a paſſage in <hi>Amalarius de divinis Officiis,</hi> quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the ſuppoſed S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> upon the Epiſtles, produced by <hi>Salmaſius, In Apparatu:</hi>

                  <hi>quia beatis Apoſtolis decedentibus, illi qui poſt illos ordinati ſunt ut praeeſſent Eccleſiis, illis primis exaequari non poterant, neque miraculo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum teſtimonium par illis habere, ſed in multis aliis inferiores illis eſſe videbantur, grave illis videbatur Apoſtolorum ſibi vendicare nuncupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem. Diviſerunt ergo nomina ipſa, &amp; iiſdem Presbyterorum nomen reliquerunt, alii verò Epiſcopi ſunt nuncupati, hique Ordinationis praediti poteſtate, ita ut pleniſsimè iidem praepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitos ſe Eccleſiarum eſſe cognoſcerent.</hi> This is manifeſtly the very reaſon that I inſiſt upon: For, ſaith he, becauſe, <hi>the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Apoſtles deceaſing, thoſe that were ordained to be over Churches after them, could not be equalled to thoſe firſt, nor attain to the like grace of miracles, but appeared to be beneath them in many other things, it ſeemed too much for them to challenge to themſelves the name of Apoſtles. Hereupon they divided the names, and left them the name of Presbyters, and the others were called Biſhops, and they endowed with the Power of Ordaining, that they might know themſelves to be ſet over the Churches, in the fulleſt right.</hi> I marvell what pleaſure <hi>Salmaſius</hi> had to allege this paſſage, which if it be admitted, is enough alone, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all that he hath ſaid in this point. For firſt, he ſuppoſeth, as the received Doctrine of the Church, that Biſhops, in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="LXXVIII" facs="tcp:115786:215"/> Churches, ſucceeded the Apoſtles: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he anſwers all S. <hi>Hieromes</hi> reaſons, to prove that Biſhops and Presbyters are all one, becauſe they are called by the ſame name in the Scriptures, by giving another reaſon, even that which you have here: Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he ſaith that Biſhops are ſet over their Churches <hi>pleniſsimè,</hi> in the fulleſt right, and that therefore Ordination was reſerved to them, which is to ſay, that, in all things they have a ſpeciall Intereſſe, but eſpecially Ordination is their peculiar. And with this reaſon agrees <hi>Theodoret,</hi> when he ſays, that, at ſuch time as the name of Biſhops was common to Presbyters, thoſe who were called Biſhops afterwards, were called Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; extending the name of Apoſtles to others beſides the Apoſtles of Chriſt. This is then a ſufficient reaſon, why the name of Biſhops, ſhould be afterwards appropriated to that rank, wherein they ſucceed the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Evangeliſts in their reſpective Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, (becauſe they could not be called by the ſame which their predeceſſors had born) though formerly common both to Biſhops and Presbyters. And this is the meaning of thoſe words of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> which ſeemed difficult in the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> becauſe, the opinion, which derived all the power of Biſhops from the Pope, was ſo ſtrong there:
<pb n="LXXIX" facs="tcp:115786:215"/> 
                  <hi>Etſi ſecundum honorum vocabula quae jam Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae uſus obtinuit, Epiſcopatus Presbyterio major ſit, in multis tamen Auguſtinus Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Hieronyme Presbyters minor eſt.</hi> Let not the humility of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> be drawn into conſequence, and the property of his words ſhall enforce no more then I ſay. He knew well enough, how ſtiffely S. <hi>Hierome</hi> had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, that a Biſhop and a Prieſt is all one in the terms of divine Right, becauſe the name of <hi>Epiſcopus</hi> is attributed to Presbyters by the Apoſtles. Is it to be preſumed that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> acknowledges this to be his own opinion, becauſe it is plain he intends not to croſſe S. <hi>Hierome</hi> in it, having other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences with him afore? On the contrary, it hath been ſhewed by other paſſages of his writings, that his opinion was otherwiſe. To uſe therefore that civility, which his meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe prompted him to condeſcend to S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> with, he granteth his premiſes, neither refuſing, nor admitting the conſequence, ſaying, <hi>Though, according to the titles of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which now have prevailed in the Church, a Biſhop be greater then a Presbyter, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, in many things Jerome the Prieſt is greater then Auguſtine the Biſhop.</hi> Where, by naming <hi>the titles of Honour which now have prevailed in the Church,</hi> he inſinuates the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for which, I here maintain that they
<pb n="LXXX" facs="tcp:115786:216"/> were thus diſtinguiſhed afterwards, and therefore ſuppoſes the ground of it: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he might as eaſily have granted S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes</hi> conſequence, and pleaſed him more. And yet, I conceive, that, when he ſays a Prieſt may be greater then a Biſhop, it may very well be admitted, not onely as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion of humility, but as an expreſſion of truth, not onely in reſpect of learning, or other perſonall conſiderations, but of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Church, by reaſon of the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Churches here premiſed. The ſtate and government of Churches is very properly compared by <hi>Origen, contra Celſum</hi> VII. to the State of Greekiſh Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Biſhop bearing the place of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, and the Bench of Presbyters, of the Senate, as I have hitherto compared them to the Jews Conſiſtories; and, as Pope <hi>Pius</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Juſtus</hi> of <hi>Vienna,</hi> calls the Presbytery of the Church at <hi>Rome, Pauperem Senatum Chriſti in Vrbe Româ; The poore Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of Chriſt in the City of Rome.</hi> In this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and condition, the eminence of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop above the Presbyters is viſible, though not by the humility of Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps compriſes both Biſhop and Presbyters in the ſame quality of a Senate, yet by the compariſon of <hi>Origen,</hi> the eminence of the Magiſtrate above his Councell, in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalties,
<pb n="LXXXI" facs="tcp:115786:216"/> being ſo viſible as it is. But, when congregations come to be diſtinguiſhed, as well as Churches, and a greater flock aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to ſome Presbyters, then to Biſhops in other parts of the Church, and thoſe Presbyters to doe all Offices to their Flock, which thoſe Biſhops did, ſaving that they depended on the City Church, whereas thoſe Biſhops depended onely on the Church of the Mother City, (and therefore had Power to make Ordinations within their own Churches, which Presbyters ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could doe;) what hinders in this caſe, I ſay not S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (for I ſuppoſe he names himſelf but for an inſtance, being indeed Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of an eminent City) to be leſſe then S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> but, ſome Biſhop to be leſſe then ſome Prieſt, even for his lawfull authority in the Church? A conſideration of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to the right conſtitution of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, eſpecially the moſt Generall, and, for which, there is not wanting a valuable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, intimated in the proceedings of divers of the ancient Councels of the Church, that is, that the Church cannot be reaſonably concluded by number of preſent votes, as the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> impoſes upon us, but, by the conſideration of Chriſtian Nations, and Provinces of the Church, repreſented in thoſe Councels. For, as we ſee, that, in the
<pb n="LXXXII" facs="tcp:115786:217"/> ancient Councels, a few Biſhops were many times admitted to act in behalf of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, as having Commiſſion to conclude them, in which caſe, they muſt needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, according to the Provinces for which they ſtood: So, in all things, which may concern the Whole, not onely every mans rank of Biſhop, Presbyter, or Deacon is to be conſidered, but alſo, the eminence of the Church in which he bears the ſame. So that, by this reaſon, nothing hinders a Presbyter of ſome chief Church to be of more conſideration to the Whole, then a Biſhop of ſome mean Church, ſuch as we ſpoke of in <hi>Africk.</hi> And therefore, it would be inconſequent, that the determinations of Synods ſhould paſſe indifferently by the Votes of Biſhops, unleſſe we ſuppoſe, that conſideration is had of the chief Churches; and this conſideration anſwered, in the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of that reſpect, which the Biſhops of thoſe chief Churches enjoy, inſwaying the determinations of thoſe Synods to which they concur. And this conſideration might, perhaps, have ſerved to take off part of S. <hi>Hieromes</hi> diſpleaſure againſt Biſhops, grounded upon the Power which their Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons had, by their means, above Presbyters, which he, in regard of the great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two degrees in generall, thinks to
<pb n="LXXXIII" facs="tcp:115786:217"/> be ſo great an inconvenience, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> LXXXV <hi>ad Euagrium.</hi> For, though it is moſt true, in regard of the Presbyters and Deacons of the ſame Church, that it was a diſorder, that Deacons, in regard of their neerneſſe to the Biſhops, ſhould take upon them above Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, yet, if we compare the Deacon of a chief Church, with the Presbyter of a ſmall country Pariſh, no man can ſay, that he is of leſſe conſideration to the Whole Church, in regard of his rank, unleſſe he mean to make <hi>Steven</hi> or <hi>Philip, Titus</hi> or <hi>Timothy,</hi> (or any of thoſe that waited on the Apoſtles in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and were properly their Deacons, as I have ſaid, in aſſiſting them to preach the Goſpel where they came) to be meaner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Church, then one of thoſe Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, which <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Titus</hi> or <hi>Timothy</hi> Ordained, in the Churches of thoſe Cities where they came.</p>
               <p>To that which I ſay <hi>p.</hi> 92. to prove, that the word Angel, in the Epiſtle to the VII Churches, <hi>Apoc.</hi> II <hi>&amp;</hi> III. being an obvious and proper metaphor to ſignifie a Biſhop or Presbyter, cannot therefore be uſed to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a College of Presbyters, the word being no collective, nor any conſtruction inforcing it to be uſed for a collective, in all that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, I adde here the compariſon of two paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, by which it may be gathered, for what
<pb n="LXXXIV" facs="tcp:115786:218"/> reaſon, and in what conſideration, the Spirit ſpeaketh to the Body of thoſe Churches, in the Epiſtle directed to the Angels of them, and, by conſequence, who thoſe Angels are: The firſt is that of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus</hi> II. 10. <hi>A man that is an Heretick after the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond admonition avoid.</hi> For, is it S. <hi>Pauls</hi> purpoſe to command, that onely <hi>Titus</hi> avoid thoſe whom he ſhould declare Hereticks? Surely, that would be to no great effect, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we underſtand, that, by virtue of this precept, both <hi>Titus</hi> is enabled to charge the Churches under him to avoid them, and they thereupon obliged to doe it. The other is the Epiſtle under the name of <hi>Ignatius</hi> to <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> wherein, after ſuch adviſe as he thought fit for <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> without turning his ſpeech from him to another perſon, he proceeds to exhort his people, with ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, as he found to bee moſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite. Which feems to be the reaſon why ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny count that Epiſtle counterfeit, and none of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his own, though, for my part, I confeſſe, I am not yet perſwaded to think ſo, not onely becauſe of the character, both of the matter and language of it, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to me to carry the ſtamp of Apoſtolicall upon it, as the reſt of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> but alſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, becauſe of the example of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle of S. <hi>John</hi> to the VII Churches,
<pb n="LXXXV" facs="tcp:115786:218"/> wherein, it is plain, he involves both Paſtor and flock in the ſame praiſes, reproofs, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes, and exhortations, the reaſons being the ſame in both, becauſe both ſent to be read to the People in the Church, as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Coloſsians</hi> and the <hi>Laodiceans, Coloſſ.</hi> IV. 15. and, as the Epiſtle of <hi>Clemens</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, Euſebius</hi> ſays, was wont to be read in that Church in his time. Now, if the inſtructions concerning the people be addreſſed to <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Polycarp,</hi> is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſome eminence of authority in them, by which they might be brought into effect among their people? How much more that which is addreſſed unto the Angels of VII Churches, being a ſtyle apt to ſignifie a perſon of eminent authority over others, but never uſed to ſignifie a Body of perſons, much leſſe, with parallel authority among themſelves?</p>
               <p>It is commonly conceived, that the Souls under the Altar, which we reade of <hi>Apoc.</hi> VI. 10. were ſeen by S. <hi>John,</hi> lying under the Altar of Burnt Sacrifices, at the foot where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the reſt of the blood that was not ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on the Altar was poured out, and, the blood being the life or Soul of living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in the language of the Scriptures, that therefore, the ſouls of thoſe that were ſlain for the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, are ſeen by
<pb n="LXXXVI" facs="tcp:115786:219"/> S. <hi>John</hi> under the Altar. Againſt this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion I allege, <hi>p.</hi> 95. that it is not the Altar of burnt Sacrifices, but the Altar of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, (within the Tabernacle, but without the Vail) which is repreſented in theſe Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, correſpondent to the Primitive faſhion of Churches, where, the Communion Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, (called alſo the Altar, becauſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Croſſe repreſented upon it) ſtood in the midſt of that compaſſe, which the Seats of the Biſhop and Prieſts did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe. For, though, in the Temple, the people prayed without the Sanctuary, the Prieſt whoſe Office it was, at the ſame time offering Incenſe with their Prayers, yet in the Church, where all the people are within the Sanctuary, as Prieſts, the XXIV Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters are deſcribed with golden Vials full of Incenſe, which is the peoples prayers, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let my prayer be ſet forth in thy preſence as the Incenſe, Apoc.</hi> V. 8. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Angel puts Incenſe upon his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, to the prayers of the Saints, <hi>Apoc.</hi> VIII. 3. therefore his fire is from the Altar of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, within the Tabernacle, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Vail.

And this notion of the word is almoſt always to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, by the text and conſequence of thoſe paſſages where it is found. Therfore the word <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="LXXXIX" facs="tcp:115786:220"/> at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were firſt conſtituted to wait upon the Apoſtles, by doing that Service, which they did themſelves at the firſt, for the Church: whereupon, it was afterwards a cuſtome in the Church, that there ſhould be VII Deacons in every Church, as there were at <hi>Jeruſalem, Concil.

And therefore, the Author of the Queſtions of the Old and New Teſtament in S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Works <hi>Q.</hi> CI. having obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Apoſtles call Presbyters their fellow Presbyters, addeth, <hi>Nunquid &amp; Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtros condiaconos ſuos diceret Apoſtolus?

Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the Office of Biſhops is called a Miniſtery very anciently, by Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Juſtus</hi> of <hi>Vienna,</hi> as alſo the Office both of Biſhops, Presbyters, and Deacons, <hi>Concil.

<pb n="XC" facs="tcp:115786:221"/> power of the World, as proceeding, originally, not by conſtraint, but by conſent: and ſo they are called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and their office <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in Greek, becauſe their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is for the behoof of the people; and in their ſtead: But they cannot therefore be called Miniſters of the People, as Deacons are Miniſters of Biſhops and Presbyters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, then, they ſhould be ruled by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and execute that which they preſcribe, (as the Apoſtles, being Miniſters of God in Preaching the Goſpel, are bound to execute his Commiſſion, and nothing elſe) which, the Clergy of Chriſtian Churches may not doe.</p>
               <p>That it may be beyond any Power upon earth, to aboliſh the Order of Biſhops out of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> without aboliſhing the Church alſo, as is ſaid here <hi>p.</hi> 129. I prove Chap. V. to wit, that no Secular Power can take away Eccleſiaſticall Power, from them that lawfully have it, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Apoſtles, though not by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of it.</p>
               <p>To ſhew, that, in the judgement and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Primitive Church, all Power of baptizing was derived from the Biſhop, as is ſaid here <hi>p.</hi> 136. we have but to remember the cuſtome of the Church, mentioned in ſo many Canons, of ſending the Chriſm to all
<pb n="XCI" facs="tcp:115786:221"/> Pariſh Churches, from the Mother Church, once a year. By which Ceremony it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the Biſhop truſted his authority of admitting to the Church by Baptiſm, with the reſpective Paſtors of the ſame. And therefore, it is not unreaſonably judged, that this cuſtome of Chriſming was, many times, in ſtead of Confirmation, to thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that uſed it. Beſides, in that, from the beginning, no Eccleſiaſticall office was to be miniſtred by any but the Biſhop in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, the dependence of all Eccleſiaſticall authority, whereby the ſame are miniſtred, upon the Biſhop, is evidenced to us. Thus, in the paſſage of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> concerning <hi>Origens</hi> Preaching before he was of the Clergy, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>p.</hi> 106. it is further to be obſerved, that the inſtances there alleged ſeem to ſhew, that the Primitive Biſhops, did many times admit thoſe that were of no degree in the Clergy, to preach in their own preſence. Which, that it was a further privilege, then onely to preach, may appear by that which is related out of the life of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in the Primitive government of Churches, <hi>p.</hi> 113. that he was imploied by the Biſhop his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, to preach to the people in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and ſtead, becauſe he had ſeen it ſo practiſed in the Eaſt, though in thoſe parts it were not done. In like manner, it is manifeſt
<pb n="XCII" facs="tcp:115786:222"/> by many Records of the Church, that none might Baptize, Celebrate the Euchariſt, or reconcile the Penitent, in the Biſhops pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but himſelf: for of Confirmation and Ordaining, I need ſay nothing.</p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon againſt the vulgar rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the XIII Canon of the Councell at <hi>Ancyra. p.</hi> 141. will be more clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, by ſetting down the effect of the LVI Canon of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> which, comming after that of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> and, taking Order, that, for the future, there ſhould be no Country Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops made any more, provides further, that thoſe which were already conſtituted, ſhould do nothing without the conſent of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, as likewiſe the Presbyters to doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without the ſame. Which, being the proviſion which the latter Canon eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, leaveth it very probable, that the other, going afore, and intending to take order in the ſame particulars, ſhould conſiſt of two clauſes correſpondent to the ſame.</p>
               <p>That there were other Churches, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> beſides that of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> before the time of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> beſides that which hath been ſaid <hi>p.</hi> 142, 143. ſtands more probable by the Emperour <hi>Adrians</hi> Epiſtle, related by <hi>Vopiſcus</hi> in the life of <hi>Saturninus; Illi qui Serapin colunt Chriſtiani ſunt; Et devoti ſunt Serapi, qui ſe Chriſti Epiſcopos</hi>
                  <pb n="XCIII" facs="tcp:115786:222"/> 
                  <hi>dicunt. Nemo illic Archiſynagogus Judaeorum, nemo Samarites, nemo Chriſtianorum Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, non mathematicus, non aruſpex, non aliptes.</hi> Here he names Biſhops at <hi>Alexandria;</hi> to wit, ſuch as reſorted thither, from other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> And, though a man would be ſo contentious, as to ſtand in it, that the name <hi>Epiſcopus</hi> might then be common to Biſhops and Presbyters both, yet, when he ſpeaks of <hi>Presbyter Chriſtianorum</hi> in the very next words, he cannot reaſonably be thought to ſpeak of Presbyters in thoſe that went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And when <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> the Father of the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> expected to have been made a Biſhop for his wit and eloquence, and, becauſe he failed of it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his minde to make a Sect apart; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of himſelf might be the Head, <hi>adverſus Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentin. cap.</hi> IV. unleſſe we ſuppoſe more Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops then one in <hi>Aegypt</hi> at that time, we tie our ſelves to ſay, that he would have been Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> Which, had it been ſo, <hi>Tertullian,</hi> probably, would have expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for the eminence of the Place.</p>

So then, they were next under their Wiſe men or Doctors, but above Scribes or Clerks, by this account: But, ſeeing there was no more difference between them, it is no marvell, if ſometimes it be not conſidered. <hi>Maimoni,</hi> in the Title of learning the Law, ſheweth, that the Jews had every where Schoolmaſters

                  </gap>, though the Originall of it be not found in the Scriptures, (as how ſhould any language be all found in ſo ſmall a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume?) yet, in the Jews writings, and alſo in the Syriack Teſtament, the word from whence it is derived ſignifieth contracts, as <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> II. 14. So that, by their name, they muſt be ſuch as write contracts, that is, Clerks or Notaries. Therefore, if the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Doctors of the Jews Conſiſtories are correſpondent to the Presbyters of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches, which by many arguments

               <p>To this III Chapter I muſt adde two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations: The one is of the ſcope of that little Piece, of the Right of the People in the Church, which the learned <hi>Blondell</hi> hath late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly added to <hi>Grotius</hi> his Book, <hi>De Imperio Summarum Pateſtatum in Sacris.</hi> Which is, in brief, to derive the right and Title of Lay Elders from the people, and, from that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſe, which, by the Scriptures, it appears that they had from the beginning, under the Apoſtles, in Church matters. Whereby, he hath given us cauſe to cry aloud, Victory, as quitting the reaſon and ground upon which the bringing of Lay Elders into the Church, was firſt defended, and is hitherto maintained among us, to wit, that onely Text of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
                  <pb n="XCVII" facs="tcp:115786:224"/> V. 17. <hi>Let the Elders that rule well be counted worthy of double Honour, eſpecially thoſe that labour in the Word and Doctrine.</hi> For, this Scripture being abandoned, the reſt that are pretended, are ſo far from concluding, that they cannot ſtand by themſelves. Now, that this Text cannot be effectuall to prove that purpoſe, he argueth there upon the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which here I have advanced, <hi>p.</hi> 123. to wit, becauſe the ſame Honour, that is, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, is thereby allowed to thoſe that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the Word and Doctrine, and thoſe that doe not: Whereupon, it muſt needs appear, to him that knows a great deal leſſe of the Antiquity of the Church then <hi>Blon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell</hi> does, that they are Clergy men, whoſe maintenance is provided for by the Apoſtle. Now, to comply with him, that hath ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly yeelded us the Fort, I doe avow, that he hath reaſon to beleeve, that, (there being ſo great difference between the State of the Church, ſince whole Nations profeſſe Chriſtianity, and that which was under the Apoſtles, and, the confuſion appearing ſo endleſſe, and unavoidable, that muſt needs ariſe in Church matters, by acquainting all the People with the proceeding of them, and expecting their ſatisfaction and conſent in the ſame) it cannot be contrary to Gods Law, to delegate the Intereſſe of the People,
<pb n="XCVIII" facs="tcp:115786:225"/> to ſome of the diſcreeteſt and moſt pious of them, choſen by them, to concur in their Right. For, in this quality, doe thoſe Elders of the People, of which <hi>Juſtellus</hi> writeth, act in Eccleſiaſticall matters, as you may ſee by that which I have ſaid, in the Apoſtolicall Form of Divine Service, <hi>p.</hi> 96. and in all other the particulars which he allegeth. And, if this be it which the Presbyterians demand, in behalf of their Lay Elders, let them firſt accord themſelves with thoſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, concerning the due Intereſſe of the People in Church matters, and my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſhall be, that the Church may ſafely joyn iſſue with them, not to yeeld a double number of Votes to Lay Elders, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of all Church matters, as the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for eſtabliſhing the Presbyteries ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points, (which is to make the Clergy truly Miniſters, not of God, but of the People) but to grant them a right of Interceſſion, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the People, (when as the proceeding may be argued to be contrary to Gods Law) grounded upon the practice recorded in the Scriptures, and continued under the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, by which the people were ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, even of the proceedings of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves in Church matters. For, by this Right and Intereſſe, the Acts of the Church ſhall not be done by any Vote of
<pb n="XCIX" facs="tcp:115786:225"/> the People, but, the Rule of Chriſtianity, and the Conſtitution of the Church accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods Law, ſhall be preſerved, which are the inheritance of Chriſtian people.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, concerning the different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſe of Clergy and People, in judging the cauſes of Chriſtians, before any State pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſtianity, ſuppoſing that which hath been proved in the firſt Chapter, that our Lord and his Apoſtles ordain, that they goe not forth of the Church, to be judged in Heathen Courts, upon pain of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication to them that carry them forth. For, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to appoint, that the leaſt eſteemed of the Church be conſtituted Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in thoſe cauſes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> VI. 4. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, not Biſhops, nor Presbyters, nor Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, which muſt needs be of moſt eſteem in the Society of the Church, but the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt of the people. Which, though it muſt needs be ſaid by way of conceſſion, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that is, that they ſhould rather ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point ſuch men, then carry their Cauſes to Secular Courts (otherwiſe, it were too groſſe an inconvenience, to imagine, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle commandeth them to appoint the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt to be their Judges) yet, ſeeing the truth of his words requires, that the ſuppoſition be poſſible, ſo that it might in ſome caſe come to effect, it ſeems that his injunction
<pb n="C" facs="tcp:115786:226"/> comes to this, that, in caſe the chief of the Church, the Clergy, were ſo imploied, that they could not attend to judge their contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies within themſelves, they ſhould make Judges out of the People. Which ſeemeth not ſutable to the reſt of the Intereſſe of the Clergy, hitherto challenged. This difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to be anſwered, by diſtinguiſhing, as the Romane Laws diſtinguiſh, between Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and Judging, though in far leſſe matters. For Juriſdiction, is ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Romane Laws, to be the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of appointing a Judge, becauſe it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended, that the Magiſtrate, which was endowed with Juriſdiction, ſhould judge all in perſon, but, ſhould give execution and force, to the ſentences of ſuch Judges as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhould appoint. So that, the adviſe of the Apoſtle, ſuppoſeth indeed, that ſome of the People might be appointed to judge the Cauſes of Chriſtians within the Church, but leaves the Juriſdiction in thoſe hands, by whom they ſhould be appointed Judges. Which, though it be attributed to the Church indiſtinctly by the Apoſtle, yet, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by our Lords appointment, the ſentence was to be executed by Excommunication, therefore, of neceſſity, the appointing of Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges muſt proceed upon the ſame difference of Intereſſes, as it hath been ſhewed that
<pb n="CI" facs="tcp:115786:226"/> Excommunication doth. And though Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſuppoſe, that there might be cauſe to have recourſe to Lay-men, for the ſentencing of differences in the Church, (as indeed, the life of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the Pontificall Book, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth, that he did Ordain, or appoint certain perſons, to attend upon this buſineſſe, that himſelf might be free for more ſpirituall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment, which ſeemeth to be meant of Lay-men conſtituted Judges) yet, by the Apoſtolicall Conſtitutions, we finde, that it was uſually done by the Clergy, II. 47. And <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> exhorting the Presbyters, not to be <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>THat which is ſaid, <hi>p.</hi> 166. that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian States, have as good right to diſpoſe of matters of Chriſtianity, as any State that is not Chriſtian hath, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of matters of that Religion which it profeſſeth: proceedeth upon that ground
<pb n="CII" facs="tcp:115786:227"/> of Intereſſe in matters of Religion, which is common to all States, to wit, that the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of matters of Religion is a part of that Right wherein Soveraignty conſiſts, in as much as it concerneth all Civile Societies, to provide, that under pretenſe of Religion, nothing prejudiciall to the publick peace thereof may be done. And truly, thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions that come not from God, may very well contain things prejudiciall to Civile Society, in as much as thoſe unclean Spirits, which are the authors of counterfeit Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, doe alſo take delight in confounding the good order of humane affairs. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, in regard, the obligation which we have to civile Society, is more felt, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtood, then that which we have to the Service of God, therefore, thoſe that are ſeduced from true Religion, are never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, by the light of Nature, enabled to maintain civile Society, againſt any thing, which, under pretenſe of Religion, may prove prejudiciall to the ſame. This is then the common ground of the intereſſe of all States in matters of Religion, which, Chriſtianity, both particularly, and expreſly eſtabliſheth. Particularly, in as much as, they that aſſure themſelves to have received their Religion from the true God, muſt needs reſt aſſured, that he, who is the author of civile Society,
<pb n="CIII" facs="tcp:115786:227"/> doth not require to be worſhipped, with any judgement or diſpoſition of minde prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to his own ordinance. Which reaſon, becauſe it taketh place alſo in Judaiſme, I have therefore, as I found occaſion, ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to declare, how that containeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing prejudiciall to the Law of Nations. And expreſly, in as much as the Goſpel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſeth it ſelf to all Nations, with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, that nothing be innovated in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile State of any, upon pretenſe thereof, but, that all, out of conſcience to God, ſubmit to maintain that eſtate wherein they come to be Chriſtians, ſo far as it is not ſubject to change, by ſome courſe of humane right. For when S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> VII. 22—com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all men to ſerve God, in that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of circumciſion or uncircumciſion, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life or wedlock, bondage or freedome, wherein they are called to be Chriſtians; his meaning is not to ſay, that a ſlave may not become free with his Chriſtianity, but, that he muſt not think himſelf free by his Chriſtianity. And, upon this ground, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all States, it is verified, that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an States have as much right in Chriſtianity, as thoſe States that are not Chriſtian have, in that Religion which they profeſſe. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ground there is peculiar to Chriſtianity, by virtue of the will of God declared to be
<pb n="CIV" facs="tcp:115786:228"/> this, that Chriſtianity be received and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Soveraign Powers of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, to whom God appointed the Goſpel to be preached. Of which afterwards.</p>
               <p>That, when the World is come into the Church, that is, when States profeſſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, it is not to be expected, that perſons of great Quality in the State, ſubmit to the Power of the Church, unleſſe the coactive Power of the State enforce it, as it is ſaid <hi>p.</hi> 168. depends upon that which I ſaid afore, that the profeſſion of Religion is common to all Nations, inſomuch that he deſerves not the benefit of civile Society, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces it. For, if the profeſſion of Religion in generall, be requiſite for all them that will enjoy civile Society with any civile Nation, then is the Communion of that Religion, which the State wherein a man lives profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, a temporall Privilege to all that enjoy it, in as much as thereby they are reputed to have that Communion with God, which the reſt of that State muſt needs be reputed to have, becauſe the Religion of the State muſt needs be reputed to be true. And, this repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation being ſo neceſſary in civile Society, that no man, eſteeming it as he ought, can lightly abandon it, it follows of neceſſity, that many will be willing to profeſſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, when the State profeſſes it, that
<pb n="CV" facs="tcp:115786:228"/> would not be willing to ſubmit unto the Power of the Church, (by which they may be deprived of the privilege of Communion in it, unleſſe they perform, as well as profeſſe it, in the judgement of thoſe whom that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is truſted with) if the coactive Power of the State did not enforce it.</p>
               <p>That which is ſaid <hi>p.</hi> 169. that Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is called by the Romanes <hi>Imperium</hi> or Empire, is chiefly meant of the Title of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perator,</hi> given <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and his Succeſſors, and the reaſon which, I conceive, it imports. For, when the People was Soveraign, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of Armies, received commonly from their Armies the Title of <hi>Imperatores,</hi> upon any remarkable exploit of War done upon their Enemies. But they received afore of the People, that which they called <hi>Imperium</hi> or <hi>Empire,</hi> (to wit, the Power of the Sword) by a peculiar Act, beſide thoſe, by which they were either made Magiſtrates, or ſet over their Provinces. Wherefore, the Title of <hi>Imperator,</hi> (given <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> in another ſenſe and notion, then other Generals had it from their Armies, or, then Magiſtrates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their commands as Generals from the People, ſaith <hi>Dion lib.</hi> XLIV.) ſeemeth to extend as far as the property of the word reacheth, to all Acts of Soveraignty which a commanding Power can inforce. All Laws
<pb n="CVI" facs="tcp:115786:229"/> being nothing elſe but Commands of that Will, which hath Power to determine what ſhall be done, in thoſe things which thoſe Laws do limit and determine: All Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracies, Offices, and Juriſdictions nothing elſe but Commands of that will, which hath Power to entruſt whom it chooſeth, with the execution of Laws, or with Power of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding in ſuch things wherein it hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined nothing afore. All theſe branches then, and productions of Soveraign Power, are in force, and may be exerciſed by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian States, as well upon Eccleſiaſticall matters, and Perſons intereſſed by the Church, as others. But, not to defeat nor void that Miniſteriall Power, which the Church having received immediately from God, enjoyeth thereby, a Right anſwerable to all the branches of Soveraign Power, in matters proper to the Church, as you have ſeen it declared <hi>p.</hi> 32.</p>
               <p>The evidence of a Legiſlative Power in the Church, is ſaid <hi>p.</hi> 175. to be as expreſſe in Gods Book, as it can be in any Book in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by God: not as if it were not poſſible, that God ſhould declare by inſpiration, more clearly, that this Power belongeth to the Church, then now it is declared in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, (for then could there be no diſpute about it) but, that it is as expreſſe as it can
<pb n="CVII" facs="tcp:115786:229"/> be in theſe Scriptures, ſuppoſing them to be inſpired by God. For, ſeeing thoſe of the Congregations think, that they have a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient anſwer to all that is brought for a Legiſlative Power in the Church, out of the Scriptures, by ſaying, that the Scriptures are given from above, and therefore the matters therein declared, being immediately commanded by God, are no ground of the like Power for the Church: It was neceſſary to remonſtrate unto them, that, if this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer were good, not onely there were no ſuch Power <hi>de facto</hi> declared, but alſo no ſuch Power could be declared by ſuch Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. And therefore, that we are to look about us, and to conſider, by what circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of things expreſſed in ſuch Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, it may appear to common reaſon, that the Church practiſed it not without authority and warrant from the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>If the Prophets of the Old Teſtament had this Power by the Law, that, if they diſpenſed with any poſitive precept of it, that precept was to ceaſe for the time, (which is not any dream of the Jews Doctors, but an opinion received from their predeceſſors, without which, they involve themſelves in moſt inextricable difficulties, that either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or give any other reaſon of the tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of High Places, before the Temple was
<pb n="CVIII" facs="tcp:115786:230"/> built, and after that, of the Sacrificing of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> in <hi>Carmell,</hi> as alſo of the forbearance of Circumciſion in the Wilderneſſe) it is no marvell, if the reproof of <hi>Ahab</hi> by <hi>Elias,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> XXI. 19—of his ſon by <hi>Elizeus,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> VI. 32. of <hi>Herod</hi> by our Lord and S. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> are imputed to the peculiar right of Prophets in Gods people, <hi>p.</hi> 179. For, ſeeing that the Law was the condition of the temporall happineſſe of that people, whereof thoſe Princes were Soveraign; and, ſeeing the Prophets were ſtirred up by God, to reduce and preſerve the Law in force and practice, as well as to point out the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and meaning of it, which the Goſpel was fully to declare, it is very reaſonable, and conſequent, that their office ſhould take place as well in regard of the Prince as of the people. Eſpecially, ſeeing it was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently underſtood, that the people, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging them Prophets, were not tied to defend them by force againſt the publick power veſted in the Prince, in caſe it were abuſed to deſtroy them, or bring their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to no effect, as it is manifeſt by the ſufferings of the Prophets in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, but, to reform themſelves, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Doctrine, in their own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and, to expect the reformation of the people from thoſe that had the power of it.
<pb n="CIX" facs="tcp:115786:230"/> And therefore, it is extremely inconſequent, that, by their example, in the time of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, Preachers ſhould make the perſonall actions, or publick government of their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Soveraigns, the ſubject of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, ſeeing that all parts of Chriſtianity may be throughly taught the people, and every perſon of the people as fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how grievous every ſin is, as if they be ſtirred to malign and deteſt their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, by being told of their ſins. How much more, when the actions in their whole kinds are not ſins, but may be involved with ſuch circumſtances, as make them conſiſtent with Chriſtianity? Beſides, ſeeing it is not every Preacher that is to regulate the proceedings of the Church, in ſuch ſins of publick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as appear to deſtroy Chriſtianity, to run before the publick cenſure of the Church, in declaring what it ought to doe, is not the zeal of a Chriſtian, but ſuch a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, as leaves the perſon that does it liable himſelf to cenſure.</p>
               <p>The ſin of Will-worſhip, which I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>p.</hi> 188. is as far diſtant from that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ſervice of God under the Goſpel, which anſwers to the voluntary Sacrifices of the Law, in my meaning, as it is in deed. For, as the Law had voluntary Sacrifices, or freewill offerings, not commanded by it, but
<pb n="CX" facs="tcp:115786:231"/> to be offered according to it, the price whereof conſiſted in the frank diſpoſition of him that offered the ſame: So can it not be doubted, that the Sacrifices of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, their Prayers and their Alms, all the Works of Free bounty and goodneſſe, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Faſting, and ſingle life with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and whatſoever elſe gives men more means and advantages to abound in the ſame, may be offered to God out of our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, not being under any Law requiring it at our hands. Onely the difference is this, that, whereas the Sacrifices of the Law are things neither good nor bad, but as they are tendred to God, either in obedience to the Law, or according to the ſame, all Sacrifice which we can tender to God under the Goſpel, muſt needs conſiſt in the ſpirituall worſhip of God: Not in the means whereby it is advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that is, more plentifully or cordially performed. Now, though the ſpirituall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God is always commanded, yet, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is not commanded to be done and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed always, it is much in the diſpoſition of Chriſtians, what times, what places, what manner, what meaſure, what circumſtances they will determine to themſelves, (being not always determined by Gods Law) for the tendring of the Sacrifice of Chriſtians, which, being ſo determined, ſhall be as truly
<pb n="CXI" facs="tcp:115786:231"/> a voluntary Sacrifice, or freewill Offering, as any under the Law, and ſo much more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent as the Law is leſſe excellent then the Goſpel. If this may be received to goe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Will-worſhip, I am ſo far from counting Will-worſhip a ſin, that I acknowledge that to be the height of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, from whence it proceedeth. But I conceive the word is not improperly uſed, to ſignifie that, which the Jews are reproved by our Lord, after the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> for, becauſe they worſhipped God according to Doctrines taught by Traditions of men. Not becauſe they practiſed the Law according to the determinations of the Greek Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which, as I have many ways ſhewed, they had expreſſe power by the Law to make; and therefore our Lord alſo commands them to obey, <hi>Mat.</hi> XXIII. 2. But, becauſe they thought there was a great deal of holineſſe, in practicing the Precepts of the Law, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely as their Elders had determined, which, ſetting aſide the obedience of Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, was nothing in Gods eſteem, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that juſtice, and mercy, and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherein the ſervice of God, then, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, conſiſted. We cannot but obſerve, that this ſin is taxed by the Prophets often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as well in the practice of thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts which are expreſſed in the Scripture of
<pb n="CXII" facs="tcp:115786:232"/> 
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, as, by our Lord and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eſay,</hi> in the ptactice of thoſe which were introduced by humane authority, <hi>Pſal.</hi> XL. 7- L. 8- <hi>Eſ.</hi> I. 12- <hi>Jerem.</hi> VII. 21—and therefore, conſiſteth not in obſerving things introduced by men, but in tendring to God, for the ſervice of God, that which was not neceſſarily joyned with the inward holineſſe of the heart, which God is to be ſerved with. This ſin of the Jews I conceive is found cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondently in other profeſſions, not onely of Gentiles and Mahumetanes, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not worſhip God without it, but alſo of Chriſtians, profeſſing true Chriſtianity, when they worſhip not God according to it: But, not becauſe they acknowledge humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, which, by Gods Ordinance, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be avoided, but, becauſe they may vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſe themſelves, in imagining, that they pleaſe God in obſerving them, without that diſpoſition of the heart which God is to be ſerved with. And this ſin of the Jews, as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> cals <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, which ſatisfies me, that it may be called Wil-worſhip in Engliſh: Though, whether the former voluntary and frank ſervice of God, is not alſo called <gap reason="foreign">

               <pb n="CXIII" facs="tcp:115786:232"/>
               <p> The reaſon why the Ceremonies of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, which are here <hi>p.</hi> 192. proved to have been uſed under the Apoſtles, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not continue the ſame in the Church of all times and places, I have briefly expreſſed <hi>p.</hi> 325. ſo that, notwithſtanding, the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the ſervice of God in publick ought to be ſuch, as may conduce to the ſame end, for which, it may appear thoſe were inſtituted, which were in force under the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>That it is a miſtake to think that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Powers are called Gods in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as is ſaid <hi>p.</hi> 214. appears further by <hi>Exod.</hi> XXII. 28. <hi>Thou ſhalt not curſe Gods, neither ſhalt thou ſpeak evill of the Ruler of thy people.</hi> For, in this place, <hi>the Prince of the people,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is a name common to Kings, Judges, and all their Governours in Chief, that were of their own Nation, whether ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, or under ſtrangers. Therefore the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice enjoyned <hi>Levit.</hi> IV. 22. belonged to the King when they were under Kings, as the Jews agree. Therefore it is given the King alſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> XII. 10. VII. 27. XIX. 1. And therefore this Law is acknowledged by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to belong to the High Prieſt, <hi>Acts</hi> XXIII. 5. becauſe, as I ſaid afore, the High Prieſts had then the Chief Power within their own People, as they had upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="CXIV" facs="tcp:115786:233"/> from <hi>Babylonia.</hi> Wherefore, ſeeing this Precept conſiſts of two parts, the ſecond whereof belongs to the King, the firſt muſt belong to the Judges of their Conſiſtories, according to the reſolution of the Jews, that all and onely Judges made by Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hands, are called Gods in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
               <p>That which is here ſaid <hi>p.</hi> 228. of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Governour under the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> in which, and by which, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> reſtoreth the Law, and ſwears the people to it, is to be compared with that which you finde here ſince, in the 57 page of this Review. Whereby it will rather appear, that he was Governour of that Province, by the like Commiſſion as other Governours of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces were conſtituted by, in the <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and after it in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire, then by any right belonging to him among his own people, ſuch as the poſterity of <hi>Zore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel</hi> had, to be Governours of the Jews that remained in <hi>Babylonia,</hi> when they were privileged to live according to their own Laws, by their Soveraign. But, whether this or that, as to the point here in hand, both are to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>I muſt not paſſe over this place, without taking into conſideration the reaſons, upon which, and the conſequences, to which <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi>
                  <pb n="CXV" facs="tcp:115786:233"/> his opinion ſeems to be advanced, in the late ſharp work <hi>de Cive,</hi> where it is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that the interpretation of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures (for which, I may as well ſay the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Giving Laws to the Church, ſeeing the greateſt difficulty lies in determining con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies of Faith) the conſtitution of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, the Power of binding and looſing, belongs to every Chriſtian State, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by the miniſtery of Paſtors of the Church: For, if this may take place, then is all that hath been ſaid to no purpoſe. And truly, I muſt imbrace and applaud one poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon which all this proceeds, that the Church, to which any Right, or Power of acting according to any right, is attributed in the Scriptures, muſt needs be a Society that may be aſſembled, and therefore ſtands obliged to aſſemble: But, that hereupon alone it ſhould be inferred, and taken for granted, that therefore, a Chriſtian State, and a Chriſtian Church are both the ſame thing, diſtinguiſhed by two ſeverall cauſes and conſiderations, when both conſiſt of the ſame perſons, I have all the reaſon in the World to ſtand aſtoniſhed. For, it is not the perſons, (which are ſuppoſed here to be the ſame) that any queſtion can be made of, neither can the Church and the State be ſaid to be the ſame thing, becauſe they are
<pb n="CXVI" facs="tcp:115786:234"/> all the ſame. For, we ſpeak not here of the nature of the perſons, their ſouls or bodies, or any thing that either of both is endowed with, but we ſpeak here, of the quality of a State, or a Church, affecting all thoſe perſons together, upon ſome voluntary act of God, or of themſelves, or both, without making any change in the nature of any perſon ſo qualified, onely ſuppoſing the perſon whoſe act it is, able to doe the act, upon which they are qualified to be a State or a Church, and, by doing it, to oblige or privilege the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons on whom it paſſes. Which kinde of things, are oftentimes, by Philoſophers, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and Lawyers, called, to very good purpoſe, <hi>Morall things:</hi> Such are all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of rights, in all manner of Societies whatſoever, being nothing elſe, but abilities of doing ſomething, which are not in other men not endowed with the ſame. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſeeing that all the objects, of any faculty, naturall or morall, any habit of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or vice, (or, that which is neither, but conſiſts in skill or knowledge, or any perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of nature, for which a man is neither good nor bad) may be denominated, and qualified, by the faculties or habits that are exerciſed upon them, by the ſame reaſon, as colour is ſaid to be ſeen, or, as that is ſaid to be right and juſt, which is done according
<pb n="CXVII" facs="tcp:115786:234"/> to juſtice; therefore, by the ſame common reaſon, if there be ſuch a thing as Holineſſe in the ſouls of men, which diſpoſes them to reverence God, by tendring him that ſervice which may expreſſe it, then are the Means, and the Circumſtances, the Times, the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the Perſons by which this reverence is publickly tendred to God, capable to be denominated Holy, by a morall quality, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from that Holineſſe which dwels in the ſouls of Chriſtians, and not onely capably, but actually ſo qualified in point of right, ſuppoſing that which hath been proved <hi>p.</hi> 212—that the practice of Gods people evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced by the Scriptures, proves the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the ſame to be effectuall and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, for the maintenance of that reverence of God, in thoſe acts of his ſervice, wherein the Holineſſe of Chriſtians conſiſteth. This, though it belong not to my preſent purpoſe, I have ſet down upon this occaſion, out of a deſire, further to declare the nature of that Holineſſe, for which, Times, Places, and Perſons, as alſo all other means which God is ſerved by, are ſaid to be Holy, and for what reaſon I call it <hi>p.</hi> 217. ſometimes Morall, ſometimes Eccleſiaſticall Holineſſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo Relative, as others many times do call it. For, ſeeing it is grounded upon the relation which is between all faculties mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="CXVIII" facs="tcp:115786:235"/> or naturall, between all habits of virtue and vice, or whatever elſe, and the objects which they are exerciſed about, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, how properly it is called Relative. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſeeing it hath been declared, that thoſe qualifications, and denominations, which ariſe upon ſome act of God, or man, having power to oblige either others or themſelves, are therefore called Morall, in oppoſition to ſuch, as make a change in the nature of mens ſouls and bodies, when they become endowed therewith, becauſe theſe Morall qualities accrue, without any change in the nature of them to whom they accrue, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Holineſſe, which belongs to things uncapable of that Holineſſe which dwels in the ſouls of Chriſtians, is properly called morall Holineſſe, as grounded upon the Will of God, appearing to have appointed the reverence of them, to maintain that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of him wherein Holineſſe conſiſteth. And as, for this reaſon, in generall, it is called morall Holineſſe, ſo, it is alſo called Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall, for the ſame reaſon expreſſed in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, as depending upon that Will of God, by which, Chriſtianity, and the Church, and the ſervice of God therein ſubſiſteth. To return then to my purpoſe, which gave me occaſion to declare this here, ſeeing that, when the queſtion is made, whether the
<pb n="CXIX" facs="tcp:115786:235"/> Church and the State, conſiſting of the ſame perſons, be the ſame thing or not, there can be no queſtion underſtood, of the nature, that is, the ſouls and bodies of the perſons, which are ſuppoſed to be the ſame, but, of the Morall beeing of a State, whether the ſame give it the quality of a Church, or not 3. And, ſeeing the beeing of ſuch things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the act by which they are conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, we have no more to enquire but this, whether the ſame Act conſtitute a Church, which conſtitutes a State: And then, a very little enquiry will ſerve to ſhew, that though all Churches, and all States, ſubſiſt by the Act both of God and man, yet they are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Acts by which they are States, and by which they are Churches: So ſeverall, that the Church ſubſiſts by immediate revelation from God, by our Lord and his Apoſtles, which no State doth; and whatſoever it is that makes any man a member of any State, it is not that which makes him a Chriſtian, and ſo, a member of the Church, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. And therefore there is a fault in the reaſon of the inference propounded, which concludes thus, that a Church muſt be that which hath Power to aſſemble the perſons whereof it conſiſts now the State is it which hath Power to doe that. For, as it cannot be denied, that all States muſt needs
<pb n="CXX" facs="tcp:115786:236"/> have Power to aſſemble themſelves, ſo it muſt not be granted, that the Church hath not Power to doe the ſame, becauſe it hath been proved here from the beginning, that the Church hath Power of aſſembling, not from any State, but immediately and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally from God, whether for the ſervice of God, or for determining whatſoever ſhall become determinable, for the maintenance of Unity among all thoſe that are to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in the ſervice of God, and the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the ſame. Truly, ſo long as by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion men became both members of a State, and of the Communion of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, the Church and the State were all one Society, as hath often been obſerved here, for the difference between the Law and the Goſpel, both ſubſiſting by the ſame Act of God, (calling them to be his people, and to inherit the Land of Promiſe, both upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of keeping his Law) and by the ſame act of the people imbracing the ſame. Which holds not in Chriſtianity, addreſſing it ſelf to all Nations, and therefore preſerving States in the condition which it findes, and yet founding a Society of the Church, upon the privilege and Charter of aſſembling for the ſervice of God, and the Power which is requiſite to preſerves the Unity of all that aſſemble, in the condition, upon which they
<pb n="CXXI" facs="tcp:115786:236"/> communicate in the ſervice of God. Which Society, as it was viſibly diſtinct from all States, for all the time between our Lord and <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſo is it acknowledged, by this author, to have ſubſiſted even under the Apoſtles, when as he alleges their Writings, to prove, thoſe rights which they attribute to the Church, to belong to thoſe States which are Chriſtian: Which, for my part, I very much marvell how he could think fit to doe, knowing, that ſuch acts as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles attribute to the Church, are ſo far from being the acts of the State, under which the Church then was, that they were prohibited by it, ſo often as the aſſemblies of Chriſtians were forbidden, as you have ſeen that many times they were. By that which hath been ſaid it may appear, what reaſon Eccleſiaſticall Writers had, to make a difference between the names of the Synagogue and the Church, appropriating the former to the Jews, and this to the Chriſtians, which I, for my part, ſo far as cuſtome will give leave, deſire to obſerve, though for the originall ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſee the name of <hi>Eccleſia</hi> was at the firſt moſt properly attributed to the whole body of Gods people aſſembled together in the Wilderneſſe, as, for example, at the giving of the Law. For, in all the divers ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in which it is uſed, ſpeaking of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
<pb n="CXXII" facs="tcp:115786:237"/> there is one and the ſame conſideration of aſſembling together to be ſeen, though, upon ſeverall reaſons, and to ſeverall purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from the Synagogue. The whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of thoſe that ſhall meet and aſſemble together in the world to come, is called ſometimes the Church, and ſo is the whole company of the Viſible Church upon earth: Becauſe, though they cannot meet bodily to communicate in the ſervice of God, yet they ought to meet with that judgement and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of minde, that they may both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate bodily in this world, when occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, and actually meet altogether in the world to come. So is the company of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, contained in, either barely one City, or the Head City of a Province or Nation, called the Church of that City, Province, or Nation, becauſe they ſo meet ſeverally, that any of them may aſſemble with any, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe under the ſame conditions. But, when one Congregation is called a Church, as ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is in the Scriptures, it is for the ſame manner of aſſembling, as the whole people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was aſſembled in the Wilderneſſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe things generally premiſed, it will not be difficult to defeat the productions of this aſſumption, in the particulars ſpecified. And firſt, according to that which is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined <hi>p.</hi> 192. I admit, that the Power of
<pb n="CXXIII" facs="tcp:115786:237"/> interpreting the Scriptures is nothing elſe but the Power of determining controverſies of Faith: Though it is not, as by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to be admitted, that thoſe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which come from this Power are as much the Word of God, as that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by the ſame, or infallible, or that we are bound to ſtand to them as much as to the Scriptures themſelves. For, <hi>the Word of God,</hi> if we will underſtand it properly, is that onely, and all that which God giveth in Commiſſion to be declared and enjoyned his people, and therefore this author very skilfully obſerveth, that <hi>the Word of God</hi> in the New Teſtament is as much as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which God gave in charge to our Lord Chriſt, and he to his Apoſtles, to be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to the world, with a charge from God to imbrace it: For ſo alſo, the Law was <hi>the Word of God</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and all the Revelations granted the Patriarchs and Prophets, were <hi>the Word of God</hi> to them, becauſe by them God declared how he would conduct his People: Whereas, after the Prophers of the Old Teſtament, though we finde that there were Prophets that ſpoke by inſpiration, not onely by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> ſpeaking of thoſe times of Gods people whereof there is no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Scriptures, but alſo by that which is ſaid in the New Teſtament of <hi>Simeon</hi> and
<pb n="CXXIV" facs="tcp:115786:238"/> 
                  <hi>Anna, Zachary</hi> and the Bleſſed Virgin, and of the Prophets of Churches; yet we do not finde it ſaid, that <hi>the Word of the Lord</hi> came to any of them, becauſe they received no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in charge from God to his People. Wherefore, that which the Church hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from thoſe perſons, that ſpoke, not onely by inſpiration and revelation, but alſo by Commiſſion from God, the evidence of which Commiſſion containeth all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to Chriſtianity, muſt not be compared with any thing, which it may receive in charge any other way, though it be ſuch as may produce an obligation to receive and obſerve it, of a nature anſwerable to the ground and intent of it, which I have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the place afore quoted. Neither is it to be ſaid that God faileth his Church, in any thing due to it, upon thoſe promiſes whereby it ſubſiſteth, if he have not provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it of ſuch a Power to be received as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, unleſſe we will ſay, that God hath tied himſelf to preſerve it free from the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation and triall of Hereſies and Schiſms, which he hath ſufficiently declared that he never intended to doe. Now, that, having determined, an infallible Power to be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, for the determining of matters of faith, by interpretation of the Scriptures, this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, in conſequence to his aſſumptions
<pb n="CXXV" facs="tcp:115786:238"/> which I have ſpoke of, ſhould challenge it to belong to all Chriſtian States, I cannot chooſe but marvell: Seeing, that, as the Scriptures come by revelation and inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God, ſo, whatſoever ſhall pretend to like authority, muſt needs proceed from the ſame: Which, if the Church, that is, all that act upon the intereſſe and title thereof, derived from the immediate appointment of God, doe, by their proceedings diſclaim, as I have declared, much more is it to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, that all States, notwithſtanding the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, muſt needs ſtand obliged to doe. For, all States content themſelves with the procuring of civile ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, for which they are inſtituted, not tying themſelves to queſtion, whether that which is done be agreeable to the will of God, which the Goſpel declareth, either for the thing that is done, which the Goſpel many times determineth more ſtrictly, then the Laws of civile States doe, or for the ſincerity of intention which it is to be done with. Wherefore, if Chriſtianity come to be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the determinations of civile Powers, then muſt the truth of the Goſpel, and the ſpirituall righteouſneſſe which it requireth, be meaſured by thoſe reaſons, which the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick peace, and civile juſtice, which preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the ſame, may ſuggeſt. Whereas it hath
<pb n="CXXVI" facs="tcp:115786:239"/> been declared, that it is not the bare profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſtianity, that intitleth any man to any degree of ſuperiority in the Church, but that, promotion to all degrees of the Clergy, doth, by the originall inſtitution and appointment thereof, preſuppoſe ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of proficience in the underſtanding and practice of Chriſtianity, rendring them both able and willing to regulate all controverſies of Chriſtianity, not according to Intereſſe of State, but according to the will of Chriſt, and that ſpirituall righteouſneſſe which he advanceth. And, though it is many times ſeen, that Secular perſons are more learned and pious in Chriſtianity, then others of the Clergy, yet, I ſuppoſe, no man of common ſenſe will preſume it ſo ſoon, of him that is not inabled nor obliged to it by his profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as of him that is. And when the queſtion is, what is agreeable to the appointment of God in ſuch matters as theſe, I ſuppoſe, it is no preſumption that God hath inſtituted any thing, becauſe it is poſſible, (for, in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall matters, what is abſolutely and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally impoſſible?) but becauſe it is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to the intent purpoſed: And, that to the purpoſed end, of maintaining the truth of the Goſpel, and that ſpirituall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which it advanceth, it is more condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, that thoſe things which concern it, be
<pb n="CXXVII" facs="tcp:115786:239"/> determined by thoſe that are inabled by their profeſſion, to ſpend their time in ſearching the truth, and engaged by the ſame, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the ſpirituall righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, then barely Chriſtians, as Secular Powers. As for the reaſon of this reſolution, becauſe, if the Power of determining matters of Faith, might be in any perſon, not ſubject to the State which the determination muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige, all that are to be obliged by it, muſt become thereby ſubjects to the Power that maketh it: As, ſuppoſing the temporall Power of the Pope, it is inſoluble, ſo, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing what hath been premiſed, it ceaſeth. For, ſeeing nothing prejudiciall to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace, or, to the Powers of the World that maintain the ſame, can be within the Power of the Church to determine, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be prejudiciall to any Chriſtian State, to receive the reſolutions and determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Eccleſiaſticall matters from Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, which may conſiſt of perſons not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to them, as well as of ſuch as are. For, if any thing prejudiciall to the publick peace, and lawfull Powers that maintain it, be advanced under pretenſe of Chriſtianity, that is, if this Power be abuſed, then have the Secular Powers right to God, as well as Power to the world, to puniſh ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts: But the Church, neither right to
<pb n="CXXVIII" facs="tcp:115786:240"/> God, nor Power to the world, of reſiſting them, though their Power be ill uſed, to the ſuppreſſion of Chriſtianity, and of that Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Power that ſtandeth by it, becauſe it is to be maintained by ſuffering the Croſſe and not by force.</p>
               <p>As for the Power of binding and looſing, it is very well underſtood to conſiſt, as well in judging that which is queſtioned to be conſiſtent or inconſiſtent with that Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which a man profeſſeth, as in remitting or retaining ſin, that is, in allowing, or voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the effect of Baptiſm, which is, the Communion of the Church. But, whereas it is ſaid, that the firſt is the right of the State, the ſecond the office of the Paſtors of the Church, I demand, whether theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors ſhall have Power to diſſent, in caſe the judgement of the State agree not with their own, or not: For, that this may fall out it is manifeſt, and, that any man, by his quality in the Church, ſhould be bound to proceed, in remitting and retaining ſin, according to his own judgement, when as, by his ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the State, he is bound to proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the judgement thereof, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience as manifeſt. Whereas, that a man ſhould be bound by his obligation to the Church, to proceed according to his own judgement in Church matters, and by
<pb n="CXXIX" facs="tcp:115786:240"/> his ſubjection to the State, to ſuffer for it, when it is contrary to the judgement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is ſo farre from being an inconvenience, that it is the neceſſary conſequence of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Chriſts Croſſe.</p>
               <p>The ſame reaſon takes place, in that which is ſaid, that the election of Paſtors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the State, and the Conſecration to Paſtors. For I have often ſhewed in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that Impoſition of Hands is a ſign of conſent, to the conſtituting of thoſe who receive the ſame, implying a Power of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, for the uſe whereof they are to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der account, if it be uſed amiſſe. And truly, that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſhould be called A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> XIV. 4, 13. in regard of their ſending by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> XIII. 1—I count it not ſtrange: For the extent of the word, and the uſe thereof will bear it: Though it is manifeſt, that otherwiſe, <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> had Commiſſion from the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> XI. 22. that is, from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: <hi>Paul, not from men, nor by men, but by Jeſus Chriſt, and God the Father that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him from the dead, Gal.</hi> I. 1. though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged firſt, (as to the Commiſſion which he received with <hi>Barnabas, Acts</hi> XIII. 2.) by the Church of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in the right of the XII Apoſtles, by themſelves at <hi>Jeruſalem, Gal.</hi> II. 9. But I
<pb n="CXXX" facs="tcp:115786:241"/> count it ſtrange, that, to prove the Power of the State in chooſing Paſtors, it ſhould be alleged, that this dictate of the Holy Ghoſt, by which <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were ſet apart to the work for which they were deſigned, <hi>Acts</hi> XIII. 2. was to be acknowledged for the dictate of the Holy Ghoſt, by the Church of <hi>Antiochia.</hi> I have ſhewed, that, under the Old Teſtament, the Conſiſtory were to judge of Prophets, and to obey them being received, which power was ſufficiently abuſed among them. I doe beleeve alſo, that there was means given the Church to be reſolved in the ſame, that the precept of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XII. 3. 1 <hi>John</hi> IV. 1—tendeth to that effect, that the grace of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Spirits, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XII. 9. was to ſuch a purpoſe: I remember the words of S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> upon the beginning of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> ſpeaking of the Old Teſtament, <hi>Erat autem populi gratia diſcernere ſpiritus, ut ſciret quos in Prophetarum numerum referre deberet, quos tanquam bonus nummularius reprobare: Now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it was a grace that the people had, to diſcern ſpirits, ſo as to know whom to reckon among the Prophets, whom, like a good Banker, to refuſe:</hi> And I have found in a written copy, containing expoſitions of divers Greek words of the Old and New Teſtament, this Gloſſe, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> that is, <hi>diſcerning of Spirits,</hi> (ſpoken of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XII. 9.) <hi>is the diſtinguiſhing between thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied truly and falſly;</hi> And this I beleeve to be S. <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning, becauſe of the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence of that which S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> relateth of the Synagogue. I muſt, therefore, needs beleeve, that the Church was provided by God, of means to be reſolved, who ſpoke by the Holy Ghoſt, who onely pretended ſo to doe: But, that Chriſtian States ſhould have Power to elect Paſtors, becauſe Chriſtian Churches were able to judge whom the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt had elected, whom not, is a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which I underſtand not. For, as it was then one thing to elect, another to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern whom the Holy Ghoſt had elected, ſo, a Chriſtian State is now far another thing then the Church of <hi>Antiochia</hi> was at that time.</p>
               <p>Neither is it any thing available to this purpoſe, which this author laboureth to prove, that the Soveraign Power, together with the Power of interpreting the Word of God, were both in the High Prieſts of the Jews, and afterwards in the Kings of Gods people, after that they were eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. For, by the particulars here declared from <hi>p.</hi> 225. it will appear, that it was no otherwiſe in the Kings of Gods people, then
<pb n="CXXXII" facs="tcp:115786:242"/> it is now in Chriſtian Princes and States, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting that the Law was given to one Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Goſpel ſent to all Nations) to wit, as for the Power of inforcing Gods Law, in the way of Fact: Whereas, the Power of determining the Law of God in the way of Right, was as much eſtated upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtories of that People, by Gods Laws, as the Power of giving Rules to the Church, is now upon the Synods of the ſame. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> a Prieſtly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as <hi>Moſes</hi> cals them, <hi>Exod.</hi> XIX. 6. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Prieſts were to be Kings of them. For, the Originall imports a Kingdome of Prieſts, which <hi>Onkelus</hi> tranſlates Kings and Prieſts, as alſo the New Teſtament, <hi>Apoc.</hi> I. 6. V. 10. Which if it ſignifie, that all the Iſraelites ſhould be both Kings and Prieſts, then certainly it inforceth not, that their High Prieſts ſhould be their Kings: But that they ſhould be Kings, becauſe redeemed from the ſervitude of ſtrangers, to be a people Lords of themſelves; and Prieſts, becauſe redeemed to ſpend their time in ſacrificing and feaſting upon their ſacrifices, (which is the eſtate, under the figure whereof God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth unto them, that which he meant to his Church, and they ſtill expect under their Meſſias, <hi>Eſ.</hi> LXI. 6.) though they ſacrificed not in perſon, but by their Prieſts appointed
<pb n="CXXXIII" facs="tcp:115786:242"/> in their ſtead, by Impoſition of the Elders hands, <hi>Num.</hi> VIII. 10. As for the charge of <hi>Joſuah</hi> to goe in and out at the word of <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azar, Num.</hi> XXVII. 21. it is expreſly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red there to be ſaid, in regard of the Oracle of God by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> which the High Prieſt was to declare, as you ſee by <hi>Deut.</hi> XXXIII 8. and <hi>Joſuah</hi> to conſult in all his undertakings. For, this is one of the principall reaſons, why the government of that people, before they had Kings, was, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> cals it, <gap reason="foreign">

And therefore, it is not to be ſaid, that of Right the High Prieſts ought to have had the Power, though <hi>de facto</hi> the Judges had it during their time: For, if it be ſaid, that the Iſraelites caſt off God, <hi>Jud.</hi> II. 10. becauſe they would not be ſubject to the High Prieſt, but imbraced the Judges it could not be underſtood, how they ſhould refuſe God by refuſing <hi>Samuel,</hi> that

               <p>SEeing it is here declared <hi>p.</hi> 255. that, whoſoever thinks himſelf authorized by his Religion to unſettle the publick peace, or to maintain his Religion by force, his ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile obedience being diſpenſed with by the ſame, is thereby an enemy to the State, and liable to temporall puniſhment, according to the degree of that which he doth, it may be thought requiſite here to reſolve two ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that may be put in this point. The one, whether the enemies of the Religion in force, may become liable to puniſhment, for blaſphemies and ſlanders upon the Religion of the State. The other, to what temporall puniſhment men may become liable, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing their Religion, not being expreſly permitted by the State to be exerciſed. To the firſt, my anſwer is reſolutely affirmative. For, ſeeing that Chriſtianity enjoyneth us to ſeek the good of all that are enemies to it, it is not imaginable, that it ſhould oblige any Chriſtian to defame or blaſpheme any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Religion, ſeeing that muſt needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the diſgrace of them that profeſſe it, moſt of all if they be the publick Powers that maintain it, all irreverence of whom up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what cauſe ſoever, muſt needs tend to
<pb n="CXXXVI" facs="tcp:115786:245"/> weaken the arm of Government, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to unſettle the publick peace. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you ſee what teſtimony the Apoſtles have from a ſtranger, <hi>Acts</hi> XIX. 37. <hi>You have brought theſe men, that are neither Church. robbers, nor blaſphemers of your Goddeſſe:</hi> By which inſtance we may be aſſured, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity obligeth us not, to ſeek by ſcorn to bring any man out of love of a falſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, if they did it not to Idolaters. And truly, though the Iſraelites are commanded to deſtroy all monuments of Idolatry, with all the ſcorn poſſible, yet that is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the Land of Promiſe, which God made them maſters of, upon that condition, but, under other Dominions, it is provided by the ſecond Commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt not bow down to them nor worſhip them:</hi> not, thou ſhalt not blaſpheme them, or ſhew de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite againſt them. <hi>Joſephus</hi> indeed, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preteth that precept of the Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt not curſe Gods,</hi> to mean, that they are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den thereby to blaſpheme the Gods of the Gentiles. Wherein, though, it ſeems, he flattereth the Romanes, (for you may have ſeen another ſenſe thereof before) yet this interpretation is preſumption enough, that they were not commanded by the Law to doe it. I will not therefore condemne the Chriſtians of the Eaſt, for ſinging to <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
                  <pb n="CXXXVII" facs="tcp:115786:245"/> face, (as the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories tell us) <hi>Their Idols are ſilver and gold,</hi> and, <hi>confound<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d be all they that worſhip carved ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:</hi> Becauſe we know particularly, that the Chriſtians of his time were reſolved to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for their Chriſtianity, rather then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves by force: And therefore, cannot interpret it to be done in ſcorn to him, but to proteſt their reſolution againſt Heatheniſm, as alſo many zealous acts of the Primitive Martyrs muſt be interpreted. But I will make this inference, to prove that in point of right, which you have ſeen was true <hi>de facto,</hi> that, becauſe Chriſtianity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth the eſtate of the world in the ſame terms, and under the ſame Powers, which it findeth, therefore it enjoyneth no man to blaſpheme the Religion of the lawfull Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the world, becauſe thereby themſelves would be brought into contempt, to the undermining of the obedience due to them. And therefore this inference proceedeth not upon ſuppoſition of the truth of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but upon a reaſon common to all civile Societies, whether Chriſtian or otherwiſe, which Chriſtianity prejudiceth not, but maintaineth. As for the ſecond doubt, it muſt alſo be reſolved, that thoſe, whom Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian States hold themſelves not enabled to put out of the World, or out of the State,
<pb n="CXXXVIII" facs="tcp:115786:246"/> for profeſſing any Religion, thoſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo puniſh for the exerciſe of that Religion which they profeſſe. For, if it be ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for all men to profeſſe and exerciſe ſome Religion, that they ſhould be out of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Law of Nations, that ſhould profeſſe to have none, and that, to profeſſe a Religion and not to live according to it, is a bare profeſſion, that is, a preſumption, that he hath none that doth ſo, it follows, that civility, and the Law of Nations will inable all men to live after the Religion which they profeſſe: And therefore inable no State ſo to puniſh men for ſo doing. In the mean time, no State is hereby obliged to leave the exerciſe of other Religions, beſide that which it ſelf profeſſeth, either free, or Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. For, I conceive the exerciſe of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is underſtood to be free, in regard of thoſe Penalties, which are in the Power of every State to inflict, on thoſe that conform not to their own, according to that which hath been ſaid. And to be publick is a further privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, though it neceſſarily import no more then Toleration containeth. For, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians before <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had not only Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and thoſe endowed with Lands and Revenues, as it appeareth by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> but thoſe Lands and Revenues were the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon goods of thoſe Churches, meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="CXXXIX" facs="tcp:115786:246"/> it was counted Sacrilege, to ſpoile that Religion which was not counted Sacrilege. And yet this was no more then Toleration, for, when the Soveraign Power would have Chriſtianity goe for Sacrilege, immediately they were ſpoiled of all under <hi>Diocletian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which is here reſolved <hi>p.</hi> 259. that, meerly a falſe opinion in matter of Religion is not to be puniſhed with Baniſhment, which is civile death to the State whereof a man is, occaſions a queſtion concerning <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> baniſhed to <hi>Triers</hi> by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and the ſame <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and many more by <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Valens,</hi> and others, wherein the injuſtice of the puniſhment lay, whether the Power was onely abuſed, or alſo uſurped. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it is to be anſwered, that the ſentence of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> upon <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> neither im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported Baniſhment, nor paſſed meerly in conſideration of his opinion in Religion. For, ſeeing the place of abode to which he was confined, was within the State whereof he was, ſo that, not changing Laws, or Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, (for he muſt needs be underſtood over all the Romane Empire) he could not be ſaid to live among them that were barbarous to him, or he to them barbarous, he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed free of the State whereof he was afore, though not in poſſeſſion and uſe of that rank and eſtate which he bore in it. As for the
<pb n="CXL" facs="tcp:115786:247"/> cauſe of this ſentence, it is manifeſt by the relation, that it paſſed in conſideration of the publick peace, which ſeemed to ſuffer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſubmitted not the truſt which he had from the Church to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Emperour, in abandoning that which the Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> had done in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing <hi>Arius.</hi> But the ground of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> his ſentence upon <hi>Liberius</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> of <hi>Vercellae,</hi> was meerly for acting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their opinion in Religion. <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> for not condemning <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in the common cauſe of the Church, <hi>Euſebius,</hi> for voting according to his judgement in the Councell at <hi>Millane.</hi> As for the ſentence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Liberius,</hi> it is the ſame with that upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius,</hi> but that upon <hi>Euſebius,</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to live in the deſerts of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ſeems to have as much difference from it, as there was between <hi>relegatio</hi> and <hi>deportatio</hi> among the Romanes, the one being but a confinement to a ſtrange people under the ſame State, the other to no people, but to ſome deſert Iland, or inhabitable place, ſuch as the deſerts of <hi>Aegypt</hi> were, which is, to be removed from the Society of civile people. Wherefore, as it is no inconvenience to grant, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> uſed ill the Power that he had, ſo, that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> uſurped that which he had not, ſeeing we know, that the
<pb n="CXLI" facs="tcp:115786:247"/> Arians under him, ſo perſecuted the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Chriſtians, as I have proved, that no So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Power can allow any Subject to be perſecuted for Religions ſake, neither ever did the Catholicks perſecute them again. By the premiſes it may appear, that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which is commonly called by the term of Baniſhment, may, by the diſpoſition of Soveraign Powers, be ſo aggravated or ſo lightned by the circumſtances, that the right of inflicting it may be ſometimes ſaid to be abuſed, ſometimes uſurped. Therefore my poſition, as the reaſon of it, proceeds onely upon that which amounts to civile Death, depriving a man of his right of continuing free of the State whereof he is.</p>

                  </gap>, <hi>that to joyn Civile skill with the Prieſthood, is to ſpin two wools together that will not make one thred.</hi> I grant he ſaith, that the Aegyptians and Hebrews had once Prieſts for their Kings: But that God parted them, becauſe
<pb n="CXLII" facs="tcp:115786:248"/> his work was done with humane weakneſſe. But ſhall I count that to be againſt Gods Law in <hi>Syneſius</hi> his opinion, which he counts thoſe Biſhops happy that could goe through with? which he himſelf declares that he was not deſirous to lay aſide from his own care? which he deſires a coadjutor to be joyned with him to aſſiſt him in? The caſe was this: It was a part of the Biſhops Office, as ſtill it ought to be, to intercede with the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Powers, for favour to all charitable cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. For, among the ancient People of God, it was the Prophets Office, (who may well be called the Preachers of Chriſtianity du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that time) as you ſee 2 <hi>Kings</hi> IV. 12. and therefore of duty belongs to the chief Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of it now. In the Africane Canons it is divers times provided, that it belong to the Biſhops charge. <hi>Syneſius</hi> finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe foiled in the execution hereof by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronicus,</hi> makes a propoſition to his Church, that he may have one to aſſiſt him in it, that he might not be diverted from his Prieſtly Office for it, intending notwithſtanding, to attend it himſelf, as he ſhould find opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſo to doe. Is this the propoſition of one that thought it againſt Gods Law, for a Biſhop or Clergy man to doe it? For, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, the coadjutor which he deſires, muſt be underſtood to be a Clergy man, becauſe
<pb n="CXLIII" facs="tcp:115786:248"/> it is the Intereſſe of the Church, in which he is to act: Whereupon the Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds there to Excommunication, becauſe wronged in it by <hi>Andronicus.</hi> So likewiſe, S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> may complain of the multitude of buſineſſe which diverted him from more ſpirituall imploiment, to end the ſutes of Chriſtians which then reſorted to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop; But did S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> think it againſt Gods Law that he ſhould be exerciſed in it, and yet continue in that exerciſe? That is the point here queſtioned, whether againſt Gods Law, or according to it; as for the point of expedience I diſpute it not here, though, if <hi>Syneſius</hi> be againſt that, a man may very well ſay to his reaſons, that, for any man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to act in Secular matters towards an Intereſſe of power or profit, is a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Prieſthood, which is to act towards the Intereſſe of Chriſtianity; And therefore God hath parted all ſuch imploiment from the Government of his Church: But, that the Rulers of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity ſhould act in the Intereſſe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and to the advantage thereof in Secular, eſpecially in publick affairs, is that which all parties now declare to be well done, when it is done by Law, by doing it themſelves without Law.</p>
               <p>The diſtance between Civile and Military
<pb n="CXLIV" facs="tcp:115786:249"/> imploiment among the Romanes, whereof <hi>p.</hi> 271. appears by the proviſion introduced by the Emperours, in favour of Soldiers, that their laſt Wils ſhould be good, though made without the Solemnities of Law: Which the Laws themſelves <hi>ff. de Teſtam. Milit. l.</hi> 1. <hi>Inſtit. ead.</hi> VI. declare, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, in regard to the ſimpleneſſe or inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of Soldiers, that is, becauſe of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in the Laws, proceeding from that ſtrict attendance upon their Colours, to which Soldiers ſtood obliged all the time of their ſervice, which was, with moſt of them, the greateſt part of their lives. It is not my purpoſe to ſay, that the Clergy are not to be ſo conſtant to the ſervice of the Church, as Soldiers to their Colours: But, that the ſervice of the Church, when the State is Chriſtian, requires not that diſtance from Civile buſineſſe, as the ſervice of the Wars among the Romanes. If the ſervice of the Church conſiſted onely in Preaching, it would be much otherwiſe: But, if the ſervice of the Church conſiſt in the maintenance and advancement of Chriſtianity, then, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the Clergy underſtand wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the Intereſſe of Chriſtianity, without underſtanding the affairs of the world wherein it is ſeen, neither can they act to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the maintenance and advancement
<pb n="CXLV" facs="tcp:115786:249"/> thereof, without underſtanding it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though it appear, not onely by S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> but by <hi>Can. Apoſt.</hi> LXXX. LXXXII. and others, that, when States were not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, the Clergy were forbidden Secular bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, yet, when the State is Chriſtian, to forbid it, were to forbid the means of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Chriſtianity, in the diſpatching of ſuch buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>To that which is acknowledged <hi>p.</hi> 273. <hi>c.</hi> V. that no part of the Church can be concluded, but by the Act of the Synod reſpective to it, I adde further, that the Act thereof can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paſſe, but by the greater part of it. For, unleſſe the conſent of the Whole follow the conſent of the greater part, in doing thoſe Acts which muſt oblige the Church, as in making Canons and Ordinations, it cannot appear, how the precept of the Apoſtles, of obeying the preſent Rulers of the Church is neglected, in any Schiſm, that is effected by any part of them, and, by conſequence, there would be no ſuch crime as that of Schiſme, in any ſuch caſe. As for example, in the caſe of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> upon which, the Epiſtle of <hi>Clemens</hi> was written and ſent, which he declares <hi>p.</hi> 62. when he ſays, that <hi>it is much a ſhame for the profeſsion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that the ancient Church of Corinth ſhould maintain a faction againſt the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
                  <pb n="CXLVI" facs="tcp:115786:250"/> 
                  <hi>for one or two perſons:</hi> to wit, of the ſame rank of Presbyters, as we muſt needs underſtand it. When, therefore, both ſides follow ſome of the Rulers of the Church, how ſhould Schiſm be incurred, if, by that precept, the leſſer part were not obliged to be concluded by the greater, in things not determined by Gods Law? So, in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of <hi>Novatianus,</hi> how ſhall it be taken for Schiſmaticall, being done by three Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, unleſſe we grant, that the leſſer part is to be concluded by the greater, under the pain of incurring the crime of Schiſm? Thus, that which is here propounded, <hi>p.</hi> 249, 250. proceedeth upon the ſame ground with that which followeth <hi>p.</hi> 314, 315. which to confirm, I adde here a memorable paſſage out of the ſaid Epiſtle of <hi>Clemens,</hi> whoſe Doctrine, being received from the very mouthes of the Apoſtles, muſt needs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted their own.

The Book <hi>de Cive</hi> maintains this Poſition, that there. is but one Article of the Faith, neceſſary to ſalvation, which is, that our Lord Jeſus is the Meſſias.

And, upon theſe terms, I ſee no reaſon how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that, upon this condition, the thief upon the Croſſe is promiſed life everlaſting, and the Eunuch of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> admitted to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, that is, to remiſſion of ſins, and the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to life everlaſting: According to that which is ſaid here <hi>p.</hi> 16. that, in danger of death, or, when there appeared an ardent zeal to Chriſtianity, men were admitted to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm without regular triall, to wit, upon the free and zealous profeſſion of Chriſtianity. So <hi>Philip</hi> is ordered by the Spirit, to give Baptiſm, on the like terms as the Church uſed to doe. But this makes no alteration in the neceſſity of thoſe things, that are to be known and undertook, by thoſe that regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly come to Baptiſm, which continue no leſſe neceſſary to ſalvation, though the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of knowing and acknowledging them cannot take place, either at all, in them that die immediately, or, in them that are thus baptized, before their Baptiſm. It may then, with a great deal of reaſon be ſaid, that all that, and onely that which is contained in the Covenant of Baptiſm, is neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, among which is the Unity of the Church, and the obligation of every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="CLI" facs="tcp:115786:252"/> to contribute towards the preſervation of it: But otherwiſe, what this Covenant containeth, this is not the place to diſpute.</p>
               <p>Some of the particulars remembred <hi>p.</hi> 289. that are in the Scriptures, and yet oblige not the Church, deſerve to be conſidered more at large. That the Apoſtle ſpeaks not barely of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XI. but of the celebration thereof at their Feaſts of Love, beſide that which hath been ſaid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on divers occaſions, in this Diſcourſe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears further by this Gloſſe, which I finde in the written Copy lately alleged, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>The Lords Supper,</hi> ſaith he, is, <hi>to dine in the Church.</hi> Whereby it may appear, that the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, is properly called <hi>the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper,</hi> but not properly <hi>the Supper of the Lord.</hi> There is nothing can be propounded in a more expreſſe form of Precept, then the decree of forbearing things ſacrificed to Idols, by the Councell at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem:</hi> And yet it is manifeſt, that it was but locall: For, if it had obliged the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> could not have given them another Rule, not to condemne one another, Jews and Gentiles, for eating or not eating. For, that this caſe is compriſed within that Rule, it appeareth, becauſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> is afraid that Jewiſh Chriſtians ſhould fall away from
<pb n="CLII" facs="tcp:115786:253"/> Chriſtianity, as enjoyning to renounce the Law, and by conſequence the Author of it, which was manifeſtly the ſcandall of thoſe at <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> But, if it had obliged the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> much leſſe could S. <hi>Paul</hi> have given leave to eate things ſacrificed to Idols materially, as Gods creatures, which, you have ſeen that he doth. That, under the Apoſtles, Baptiſm, was drenching of all the body under water, appears by S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Diſcourſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> VI. 3, 4, 5. for, how ſhould the death and Reſurrection of our Lord Chriſt be repreſented by Baptiſm otherwiſe? And ſo, the exception that is taken againſt the Baptiſm of <hi>Novatianus,</hi> is, that he was, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Euſebius Eccleſ. Hiſt. VI. 43. <hi>Had water poured about him in bed, becauſe of his ſickneſſe.</hi> So, the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of drenching was due, though, I ſhewed afore, that the ſubſtance of the exception is grounded upon the weakneſſe of his reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Chriſtianity, who would not undertake to profeſſe it while perſecution appeared: For, if that had not been, the ſolemnity would not have been avoided. The Vail of women in the Church, which the Apoſtle requires 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XI. that it was to cover their faces, though laid upon the head, I will ſeek no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argument but <hi>Tertullian,</hi> though it were poſſible to finde more. For he, in his Book
<pb n="CLIII" facs="tcp:115786:253"/> 
                  <hi>De Velandis Virginibus,</hi> proveth, that the Virgins were not exempted from wearing the like, becauſe at <hi>Corinth,</hi> whither S. <hi>Paul</hi> directed this charge, they were not. And this the property of the Greek ſeemeth to argue, when the Apoſtle calleth it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XI. 4, 7. which differs ſomething from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, this ſignifying that which is onely upon the head, (and ſo was the Vaile, and therefore the woman is ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>v.</hi> 10.) the other, that which is ſo upon the head, that it comes down from the head, as to the purpoſe, before the face. Neither doe I ſee any reaſon, why we may not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Apoſtle, when he ſays, that <hi>the women ought to have power on their head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Angels,</hi> to have reſpect unto the Legend reported in the Book of <hi>Enoch,</hi> (which we ſee was read in the Church in the Apoſtles time, by the II Epiſtle of S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and that of S. <hi>Jude)</hi> of thoſe Angels that are reported there to have been ſeduced by the beauty of women, out of <hi>Gen.</hi> VI. 2. Not as if the Apoſtle did ſuppoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to be true, or did intend to give credit to the Book, but that, by alluding to a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage commonly known, he may very well be thought to intimate, that a like inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience to it, (not diſputing whether true or
<pb n="CLIV" facs="tcp:115786:254"/> not for the preſent) might fall out in the Church. For ſo, when he ſaith, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers drunk of the rock that followed them in the Wilderneſſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> X. 4. it is not, I ſuppoſe, his intent, to affirm the truth of that which the Jews ſtill tell, and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt did tell before S. <hi>Pauls</hi> time, that the water followed the Fathers over moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and valleys, in their journey to the Land of Promiſe, but, that the Fathers drank of that water, which, the Jews ſay, followed them. For, of the Jews themſelves, the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Buxtorfe,</hi> in his Preface to the Great <hi>Lexicon,</hi> is of opinion, that they doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſuch fables, as ſtories, but as Parables, and, I conceive, I have met with ſome things in their writings, that ſeem to make it proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. So again, when S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Iude</hi> cite the Book of <hi>Enoch,</hi> it is not their intent to credit it, or tie us to beleeve that which they cite out of it, but to argue thus from it, that, if thoſe that reade it, cannot but applaud the <hi>decorum</hi> which it keeps, making the good Angels ſo reverent that they would not curſe or blaſpheme Satan, what are we to think of thoſe whom they ſpeak of, that blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed, either Secular Powers, as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly underſtood, or, which perhaps is more probable, the good Angels? And thus by the way, you ſee how to anſwer the reaſon,
<pb n="CLV" facs="tcp:115786:254"/> for which ſome ſtick to receive theſe Epiſtles for Canonicall Scripture, though it hold al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in divers of S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> in which are many ſayings alleged out of Apocryphall Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. And thus, the Apoſtles expreſſion will be moſt artificially modeſt, ſuppoſing his meaning to be onely this, that women ought to be vailed, becauſe of that which we reade in the Book of <hi>Enoch</hi> to have befallen the Angels. Now in thoſe Countries, where the vail was not uſed, at the receiving of Chriſtianity, it ſeems, this precept of S. <hi>Paul</hi> was not held to oblige. As for men covering or uncovering their head in Preaching, it can be nothing to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning, becauſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the head in ſign of reverence, was a cuſtome unknown in his time. Thus you ſee, theſe particulars, propounded in the form of precepts, notwithſtanding, do not oblige the Church.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that ſcruple the ſuperiority of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, as a ſtep to bring in Antichriſt, are not onely to conſider that which is ſaid here, <hi>p.</hi> 291. that the Socinians have the ſame ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the ſubſtance of Chriſtianity, but alſo that which ſome of the Sects of this time give out, as you ſee in the beginning of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, that the making of the Church a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety or Community, was the beginning of Antichriſt, which I have ſhewed, was the act
<pb n="CLVI" facs="tcp:115786:255"/> of our Lord and his Apoſtles: And alſo, that which <hi>Eraſtus</hi> objecteth unto the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that by the means of Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Papacy, which is the Power of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, was advanced. Whereby he hath requited all their aſperſions upon Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and ſhewed all the world, that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Antichriſt is a ſaddle for all Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that it is <hi>argumentum galeatum,</hi> a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that will ſerve to diſcredit any adverſary, if it may have paſſe-port, without ſhewing, by the Scriptures, wherein the being of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt conſiſteth.</p>
               <p>And herewith my purpoſe was to reſt contented for the preſent, thinking this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for this particular cauſe, to anſwer the objection of Antichriſt with. But I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered ſince, that the whole credit of the ancient Church, and the benefit that might redound to the reſolution of all differences and difficulties, from the acknowledgement thereof, but in the nature of Hiſtoricall truth, is utterly loſt to us, by the means of this prejudice: In particular, that, by the Papers which paſſed between his late Majeſty of happy memory, and Maſter <hi>Alexander Hinderſon,</hi> lately publiſhed, it appears, that the whole iſſue of that diſpute ended in it. Upon theſe conſiderations therefore, I have thought fit further to anſwer, by denying the
<pb n="CLVII" facs="tcp:115786:255"/> truth of this interpretation of S. <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypſe;</hi> and to juſtifie this deniall, by propounding ſo probable a meaning of thoſe Propheſies to another effect, as all thoſe that apply them to the Papacy, doe ſhew they could never attain to, becauſe they are fain to Propheſie themſelves, for the meaning of part of them, which they confeſſe is not fulfilled. And this I doe here the rather, becauſe, hereby, I ſhall declare the utmoſt of that argument, which I have uſed, for the Intereſſe of Secular Powers in Church matters, grounded upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies of the calling of the Gentiles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God, declaring his will of bringing States to Chriſtianity, declareth by conſequence, that he calleth them to the ſame Intereſſe in matters of Religion, which we know was exerciſed by the Kings of his ancient people.</p>
               <p>And hereof the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> will make full proof, being nothing elſe but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of all the Propheſies of the Old Teſtament, concerning the calling of the Gentiles, and therefore fulfilled in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of the Romane Empire to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the vengeance taken upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors thereof: Which, though it cannot be fully proved, without expounding all and
<pb n="CLVIII" facs="tcp:115786:256"/> every part of it to this effect, yet becauſe, by the main hinges upon which it turns, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable men may perceive, that it cannot, nor ever will be expounded to any other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I will ſtop here a while to ſhew this, that men for the future may adviſe, before they act upon ſuppoſition of ſuch uncertain conceits.</p>
               <p>I begin with the opening of the firſt Seale, <hi>Apoc.</hi> VI. 1, 2. becauſe, as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, rides forth, thereupon, at the beginning, ſo at the end of the Propheſie, XIX. 11. he appeares again, riding on the white horſe, which he appears mounted on at the beginning: So that he which went forth to conquer at the firſt, returns to take vengeance at the laſt, as he is there deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. In the next place, I will not much intreat any man to grant me, that the ſouls under the Altar, VI. 9. are the Martyrs which ſuffered for the Goſpel under the Romane Emperours in the ten Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: For, that S. <hi>John,</hi> addreſſing this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie to the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> I. 11. and that with a promiſe of happineſſe to them that ſhould reade and keep it, I. 2. ſhould not ſpeak of things done, during thoſe times when thoſe Churches ſtood, and wherein they were concerned, is a thing that no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe can imagine. God then, being
<pb n="CLIX" facs="tcp:115786:256"/> importuned by the bloud of the Martyrs, ſheweth, that he determines to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of the ſame. Which he further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, by the viſion of ſeven Angels, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to blow ſeven Trumpets, <hi>Apoc.</hi> VIII. 2. For with theſe ſeven, appears another, that puts much incenſe to the Prayers of the Saints, upon the Golden Altar before the Throne. What prayers of the Saints, but thoſe which the ſouls of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs had made for vengeance before? For immediately thereupon, the ſaid Angel takes the Cenſer, upon which he had put Incenſe to the Prayers of the Saints, <hi>v.</hi> 3. and fills it with fire from the Altar, and throws it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, and there comes forth noiſe, thunder, lightning, and earthquake, <hi>Apoc.</hi> VIII. 5. the figures of this Vengeance. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it appears, that after the VI ſeals, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to declare the vengeance promiſed the Martyrs, becauſe, immediately after the ſixth Seale, there appears four Angels ready to deſtroy the earth, <hi>Apoc.</hi> VII. 1. But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God would ſhew his Prophet, that he meant as well to preſerve a number of his own, as to take vengeance upon the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, therefore he ſuffers them not to proceed, till his own be marked. Theſe Prayers are therefore called alſo the Prayers
<pb n="CLX" facs="tcp:115786:257"/> of all the Saints, <hi>Apoc.</hi> VIII. 3. to ſhew us, that, though they are expreſſed, at the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fifth Seale, to be onely the Prayers of the Martyrs, <hi>Apoc.</hi> VI. 9. yet we are to underſtand, that thoſe which are ſealed and ſaved from the vengeance infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted on the Perſecutors, doe joyn in the ſame: For the Martyrs, that had long white Robes given them, <hi>Apoc.</hi> VI. 10. doe appear again praiſing God in thoſe white Robes, <hi>Apoc.</hi> VII. 9, 14. But we muſt needs imagine, that the meaning of the Viſion is, that thoſe which were ſealed and ſaved, joyned alſo in the ſame praiſes of God. For <hi>Apoc.</hi> XIV. 1, 3. where the ſame CXLIV thouſand, that were ſealed afore, appear again, and immediately the ſame voice of Gods praiſes is heard, (like the noiſe of Harpers, but as loud as thunder, or as many waters) it is ſaid, that no man could learn the Song, but the CXLIV thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, redeemed from the earth. So then, both the Martyrs, and thoſe that are ſealed, joyn in the praiſes of God, therefore in the prayers alſo, for the fulfilling whereof, thoſe praiſes are tendred, which are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the Prayers of all the Saints, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as well thoſe that were ſealed and ſaved, as thoſe that ſuffered Martyrdome, are to be conceived to joyn in them, as well
<pb n="CLXI" facs="tcp:115786:257"/> as in the Praiſes of God. And therefore the Plagues which they procure, began from the going forth of the Goſpel, becauſe from thence began the ſufferings of the Martyrs, which appeared at the beginning of the fifth Seale, as alſo the Praiſes tendred to God by thoſe that were ſealed and eſcaped: Though they were not to be accompliſhed, but with the number of their brethren, that were to be ſlain as well as themſelves. Now the ſumme of the Propheſie, being propounded in the Figure of a Book with ſeven Seals, which none but the Lamb could open, <hi>Apoc.</hi> V. the effect of the ſeventh is divided into ſeven Trumpets, wherewith ſeven Angels publiſh the vengeance, which God had promiſed to take, upon the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors of his Martyrs, at the opening of the fifth Seal, <hi>Apoc.</hi> V. 9, 10, 11. VIII. 2. So that, the Martyrs being thoſe that ſuffered by the Romane Empire, the vengeance is that which was taken upon the Romane Empire. This, as the moſt judicious of our late Expoſitors confeſſeth and proveth, ſo, had he conſidered the conſequence of it, he would have found himſelf conſtrained, not to part the tenth Chapter, and that which followeth, from the reſt that went afore, but to expound all to one and the
<pb n="CLXII" facs="tcp:115786:258"/> ſame effect, the overſight whereof, is, in truth, the cauſe of his whole miſtake. For, whereas the Angel pronounceth three woes to come, upon the ſounding of the three laſt Trumpets, <hi>Apoc.</hi> VIII. 13. two whereof are repeated after the fifth and ſixth, IX. 12. XI. 14. is it not manifeſt, that the effect of the ſeventh Trumpet, is divided into, and compriſed in ſeven Vials of the laſt plagues, <hi>Apoc.</hi> XV. 1, 7. as the effect of the ſeventh Seal was, in ſeven Trumpets? otherwiſe, how comes it to paſſe, that, where the third woe is proclaimed, upon the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet, <hi>Apoc.</hi> XI. 14. there follows nothing but rejoycing? Onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, the joy of the Saints for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſtianity, is joyned with the woe that comes upon the Perſecutors. And the joy is mentioned here, the woe deferr'd, till the ſeven Vials, which contain the effect of the ſeventh Trumpet, come. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are called the laſt plagues, <hi>Apoc.</hi> XV. 1. to wit, of thoſe which the Martyrs bloud, <hi>Apoc.</hi> VI. 9, required. For the Plagues, as they began, ſo they muſt needs be accompliſhed, after the Perſecutions. And all this gap, between the ſixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and the ſeven Vials, is made on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to reveal more largely, the cauſe of
<pb n="CLXIII" facs="tcp:115786:258"/> thoſe laſt Plagues, to wit, the Perſecution which God puniſhes. For, what ſignifies the victory of <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels, over the Devil and his, and the taking of the child up to Gods Throne, <hi>Apoc.</hi> XII. 5, 7. but Gods decree that Chriſtianity ſhould prevaile? Wherefore, the flight of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man into the Wilderneſſe, following in time the fall of Satan into the world which cauſed it, <hi>Apoc.</hi> XII. 6, 9. muſt needs begin as ſoon as Perſecution for Chriſtianity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. And the ſame CXLIV thouſand, which were ſealed afore the Trumpets, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poc.</hi> VII. 3—appear again with the Lamb after ſixe of them, <hi>Apoc.</hi> XIV. 1. as having eſcaped the Perſecution repreſented in the thirteenth Chapter, as well as the Plagues attending on it, and therefore were ſealed that they might eſcape it. Therefore, the ſame perſons being preſerved, the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors muſt be underſtood. The ſame it is which S. <hi>Paul</hi> had Prophecied of, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> II. though, it ſeems there was more revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to S. <hi>John,</hi> by ſucceſſion of time. For whereas, by many paſſages of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, it appears, that he had conceived, that the end of the world was to come, within the age of men then living, perhaps at the fall of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as the Apoſtles alſo ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
<pb n="CLXIV" facs="tcp:115786:259"/> when they asked our Lord, when the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be, and what the ſigns of his comming, and the end of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> XXV. 3. to prevent the ill conſequences of this opinion, S. <hi>Paul,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the truth further revealed, tels them this muſt not be, <hi>till a departure come firſt, and the man of ſin, the ſon of perdition be revealed, that oppoſeth and exalteth himſelf above all that is called God or worſhipped, ſo as to ſeat himſelf in the Temple of God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring himſelf to be God.</hi> Which can be truly ſaid of none, but the Romane Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, who did indeed exalt themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all called God, that is, all their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary idol Gods in that they took upon them to make Gods, whom they would, and were themſelves worſhipped with divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours ſo much more devoutly, as they were able to doe more good or harm. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is here, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> VIII. 5. a term of abatement, ſignifying thoſe that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gods and are not, in which ſenſe onely the Apoſtle could ſay, <hi>there be Gods many, and Lords many.</hi> For it is a miſtake to think that Princes are called Gods in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as I have ſhewed afore. Now the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Gentiles was this, that, when the Statue of a God was ſeated in a Temple
<pb n="CLXV" facs="tcp:115786:259"/> built to him, thenceforth they thought his Deity dwelt in it, and the Temple thereby conſecrated. In which ſenſe, S. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſucceſſion of Romane Emperours as of one perſon, (as <hi>Dantel</hi> &amp; S. <hi>John,</hi> uſe to call the body of Chaldean, Perſian, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, or Romane Emperours a Beaſt) ſaith, that he ſhould exalt himſelf, <gap reason="foreign">

And ſo, that inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble difficulty ceaſes, which <hi>Grotius</hi> his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of this paſſage ſuffers, to wit, that this ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> muſt be written before the death of <hi>Caligula,</hi> which no man can eaſily beleeve, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between the Baptiſm of our Lord, upon the XV of <hi>Tiberius</hi> according to the Goſpel, and the death of <hi>Caligula,</hi> but a matter of XI years, whatſoever paſſed between the Baptiſm of Chriſt and his death, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the death of <hi>Caligula</hi> and the writing
<pb n="CLXVI" facs="tcp:115786:260"/> of this Epiſtle. This is then the firſt of the two Beaſts that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſees in the thirteenth of his <hi>Revelations,</hi> blaſpheming God, and perſecuting his Church, even the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Romane Emperours. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is the ſame, whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> propheſies in the next words, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> II. 8, 9. repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in one perſon, as before the Succeſſion of the Romane Emperours, ſo now the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Magicians and Heathen Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, the Prieſts and the Divines, whom Satan imploied to diſguiſe, interpret, and maintain Heatheniſm in oppoſition to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> may well be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>inprimis</hi> of the liſt, together with much of the fry of his Gnoſticks, who, though wearing the name of Chriſtians, yet, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing manifeſt Idolatries with their Magick, occaſioned the perſecution of true Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, by compounding a falſe out of it and Heatheniſm. But <hi>Apollonius Tyaneus</hi> muſt needs be accounted of this Body, who did many ſtrange things in S. <hi>Iohns</hi> time, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Heatheniſm, and was therefore by the Pagans oppoſed to our Lord Chriſt, as you may ſee by <hi>Vopiſcus,</hi> in the life of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and <hi>Hieracles</hi> his Book to that purpoſe, refuted by <hi>Euſebius:</hi> After him came all thoſe Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorean or Platonick Philoſophers, who
<pb n="CLXVII" facs="tcp:115786:260"/> after S. <hi>Iohns</hi> time, as they were the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Heatheniſm againſt Chriſtianity, were doubtleſſe alſo Magicians, as their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ſeems to have been, by his travels in the Eaſt, and many paſſages of his life. Such were <hi>Apuleius, Plotinus, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry, Iamblichus, Maximus,</hi> and with ſuch the Hiſtories ſhew that the perſecuting Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, <hi>Maxentius, Maximiane, Licinius,</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> converſed: Who, both by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned writings, and by ſtrange works, done by familiarity with unclean ſpirits, laboured to ſupport the credit of their Idols. Two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances I muſt not conceal in this place, the one recorded by <hi>Dionyſius Alexandrinus</hi> in an Epiſtle to <hi>Hermammron,</hi> produced by <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius Eccleſ. Hiſt.</hi> VII. 10. where he relateth of <hi>Valeriane,</hi> how he cheriſhed the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans at the firſt, inſomuch that his Court was a kinde of Church: Unto which he addeth as followeth, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Now, he that perſwaded him to be rid of them, was his Doctor, the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the Synagogue of Aegyptian Magicians: Who commanded the pure to be ſlain and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted,</hi>
                  <pb n="CLXVIII" facs="tcp:115786:261"/> 
                  <hi>as oppoſites and hinderers of their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable and deteſtable inchantments:</hi> which, he proceeds to declare, what they were, and how they became of no effect, whereſoever the Chriſtians came. And perhaps, if we had the Epiſtle at length, it would appear, that <hi>Dionyſius</hi> had interpreted the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet as I doe: For the words which <hi>Euſebius</hi> quotes, begin thus: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Accordingly,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is revelation made to S. John: For he ſaith, and there was given him a mouth ſpeaking great things, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, and it was granted him to continue two and forty moneths.</hi> Proceeding to that which I reported afore of <hi>Valeriane,</hi> in theſe terms, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>We may well marvell at both in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leriane, and eſpecially we may conſider how he ſtood affected before him,</hi> (that is, before the Magician, whom he ſpoke of, had acceſſe to him) <hi>how gentle and kinde he was to the men of God.</hi> For when he ſaith, that Saint <hi>Johns Revelations</hi> were according to what he there relates, he ſeems to make <hi>Valeriane</hi>
                  <pb n="CLXIX" facs="tcp:115786:261"/> the Beaſt, the Magician, the falſe Prophet whom he ſpeaks of afterwards. The other is out of an Edict of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> reported by <hi>Euſebius, De Vitâ Conſtant.</hi> II. 49, 50. where the great Emperour declares to all the Empire, that <hi>Apollo,</hi> that gave anſwers at <hi>Delphi,</hi> having anſwered out of the dark cave there, that the juſt upon earth hindred him from ſpeaking truth, and that was the reaſon why his Oracles proved falſe, <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletian</hi> hereupon, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Being deceived in the errour of his ſoule, curiouſly inquired of thoſe about him, who were the juſt upon the earth. And one of the Prieſts about him anſwered, the Chriſtians. But he, ſwallowing the anſwer like honey, drew thoſe ſwords that were found out againſt injuſtice, againſt blameleſſe piety.</hi> And this, he profeſſes afore God, that he heard himſelf, being then a youth, in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours preſence. By theſe two particulars we may make an eſtimate, how the reſt of the Perſecutions were moved, and therefore,
<pb n="CLXX" facs="tcp:115786:262"/> that the Body of theſe Philoſophers and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians, the Prieſts and Interpreters of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm, is called in the <hi>Revelution</hi> the falſe Prophet. So that the ſubject of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> and S. <hi>Johns</hi> Propheſies is all one; but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Perſecution ſeems to be more diſtinctly ſet down by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> though more was revealed to S. <hi>John,</hi> concerning the end of it. <hi>And now ye know what ſtaieth him to be revealed at his own time,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> II. 6, 7. <hi>for the myſtery of iniquity is at work already, onely till he that ſtaieth be ſet aſide, and then ſhall the wicked one be revealed. He,</hi> or <hi>that which ſtaieth,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or the Law. For, as long as the Chriſtians were to conform to the Law, and not to depart from the Jews, which departure, the Apoſtle cals <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> before, the deſign of Satan, to bring this Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to effect, was but a myſtery of iniquity, that is, a wicked deſign in ſecret. For, at the firſt, Chriſtians were in the ſame conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Jews, as we ſee by the Edict of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> that all Jews ſhould quit <hi>Rome,</hi> ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> XVIII. 2. that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſaith <hi>Suetonius.</hi> And that the firſt Perſecutions were ſtirred by Jews, we ſee by S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, which ſhews us, that thoſe falſe Chriſtians that conformed to the
<pb n="CLXXI" facs="tcp:115786:262"/> Law, did it, that they might not be perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Therefore, the breach with the Jews, ſetting them on work, to calumniate the Chriſtians, is juſtly ſaid, to reveal the ſecret counſell of Satan, to ſtirre Perſecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſtianity. Now this breach may well be ſaid to have begun at or about the very time when S. <hi>Paul</hi> writ this to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that the myſtery of iniquity was now in working. For, it was before this, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> was conſtrained to ſeparate his Diſciples from the Synagogue, <hi>Acts</hi> XIX. 9. And it ſeemes to be after this, that the Apoſtle writes to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to come forth of the Synagogue, <hi>Heb.</hi> XIII. 13. So that when <hi>Nero</hi> perſecuted the Chriſtians, both the departure, and the revealing of this ſecret counſell of Satan began, till, as the breach, ſo it became open and profeſſed. As for the end, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth, when he calleth the Beaſt <hi>the ſonne of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>that God ſhall deſtroy the falſe Prophet with the appearance of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> the Angel, <hi>Apoc.</hi> X. 5. ſeemeth to make it the end of the world, when he ſweareth <hi>that time ſhall be no more.</hi> But, when he addes, to limit, and to expound this aſſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>That time ſhall be no more, but that the myſtery of God which hee gave his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi>
                  <pb n="CLXXII" facs="tcp:115786:263"/> 
                  <hi>the Prophets the good news of, ſhould bee accompliſhed,</hi> wee underſtand thereby his meaning to be, that time ſhall be no more to that effect, but, that the ancient Propheſies ſhould be quite fulfilled. And, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained to be fulfilled of ancient Propheſies, but the calling of the Gentiles, which was accompliſhed, while the Vials were pouring out on the Empire, for perſecuting the Chriſtians? As for the raiſing of the dead again, and the judging of them, and the reign of the Saints with Chriſt a thouſand years, which neceſſarily come in upon the ſeventh Trumpet, or the ſeven Vials, <hi>Apoc.</hi> XI. 18. XX. 4. there will remain no great difficulty in it, if we think fit to underſtand it, as the like Propheticall Viſions in <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> from whom it is manifeſt S. <hi>John</hi> had it, are evidently to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. The judgement which <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaw ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed upon the Beaſt, which perſecuted the Jews, <hi>Dan.</hi> VII. 9—if we will not interrupt the conſequence of his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and the coherence of the Text in that place, and offer violence to our own ſenſes, is not that which ſhall come at the generall Reſurrection, but it is that, which God ſhews his Prophet, that he would exerciſe upon the Princes that ſhould afflict his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="CLXXIII" facs="tcp:115786:263"/> 
                  <hi>(Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> by name) and doe them juſtice. Juſt ſo are the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans here judged, and the Kingdome given them, as it is ſaid to be given there to the Jews, becauſe they were freed under the Maccabees, and became Lords of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaw dry bones re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, to figure the reſtoring of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, <hi>Ezek.</hi> XXXIII. 3. ſo proper is it to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, the dead Chriſtians to riſe again, and be judged, and reign, becauſe they are reſtored to freedome and authority under <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> And this it is which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the firſt Reſurrection, <hi>Apoc.</hi> XX. 6. in reſpect of the generall Reſurrection, which, he ſayeth afterwards, ſhall not be, till after a thouſand years, <hi>Apoc.</hi> XX. 11. ſo that, when he ſaith, <hi>The reſt of the dead revived not till the thouſand yeares be fulfilled;</hi> the meaning is plain, that we muſt not miſtake this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, for that which ſhall be at the end of the world. Neither is it ſaid, that the world ſhall end, with the thouſand years, after this judgement, and Satan Sealed up, and Chriſtians advanced to the Empire: For, Satan muſt be looſed again, and ſeduce <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> to War againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (perhaps after the Jews are converted to Chriſtianity, for this is all that will remain
<pb n="CLXXIV" facs="tcp:115786:264"/> unfulfilled of the <hi>Apocalypſe)</hi> and this may ſpend many hundred years, after the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand are expired. And truly, I would make no great difficulty, if need were, to take the thouſand yeares for an indefinite time, provided that the time which Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes reigned in the world, were not leſſe. But if we count from the latter ſack of <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Genſericus,</hi> to the taking of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> by the Turks, there will not be much difference: Nor could the term have been put more properly to this Propheſie, then by that Empire, which ruled thoſe parts, to the Churches whereof S. <hi>John</hi> ſends his <hi>Revelations.</hi> And this ſenſe will be a neceſſary warning to this age, that the Scriptures concurre with the works of the time, to ſhew, that Satan is looſe. Thus you ſee what occaſion there was for the opinion of the Chiliaſts among the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Chriſtians, which had it proceeded one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a Kingdome of the Saints, might as well have been underſtood of the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Chriſtian Princes under <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> as that of <hi>Daniel</hi> is rightly underſtood, of the Jews Dominion after <hi>Mattathias.</hi> And being ſo underſtood, it will without doubt adde very much to the ſtrength of that motive to Chriſtianity which is drawn
<pb n="CLXXV" facs="tcp:115786:264"/> from the Propheſies concerning the calling of the Gentiles. But the imagination of Chriſts bodily coming, whereof the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſayes nothing, as it did (if we beleeve <hi>Dionyſius Alexandrinus</hi> in <hi>Euſebius, Eccleſ. Hiſt.</hi> VII. 24.) and may adde to the truth many things prejudiciall to Chriſtianity, ſo may it alſo prove pernicious to the State of Chriſtendome. If it be objected, that the deſolation of <hi>Rome,</hi> by <hi>Alaricus</hi> and <hi>Genſericus,</hi> was nothing to that which is Propheſied of <hi>Babylon, Apoc.</hi> XVII. XVIII. let the Propheſies of <hi>Eſay</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Babylon</hi> be conſidered, which, wee know, ſtood hundreds of years after <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſo that <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaith, that we muſt expect <hi>Elias,</hi> with the Jews, to reconcile their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies with the Hiſtories. Nor is it to the purpoſe, that <hi>Babylon</hi> was utterly ruined at length: For, ſhould <hi>Rome</hi> be utterly ruined, ſo long after <hi>Alaricus,</hi> as <hi>Babylon</hi> was after <hi>Cyrus,</hi> they would not think the <hi>Revelation</hi> thereby fulfilled in my ſenſe. No more am I to think, thoſe Propheſies againſt <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> for cruelty to the Jews, fulfilled, by what fell out, when no man remembred the Jews or thoſe Propheſies. But theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> borrowed many times word for word out of the Propheſies
<pb n="CLXXVI" facs="tcp:115786:265"/> of the Old Teſtament, are nothing elſe but lofty patheticall figures, hyberbolically ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the condition of Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> which, in reſpect of the Empire quite taken from the Pagans, was left as deſolate as <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> under <hi>Cyrus.</hi> This is then the whole compaſſe of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> Chriſt goeth forth at the Preaching of the Goſpel, after the firſt Seal, to ſubdue the Empire to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. The next three Seals foretell, that God would puniſh them with the ſword, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and peſtilence for neglecting it. Which they, by the inſtinct of Satan, imputing to the neglect of their Idols, as all Hiſtories ſhew, fall to perſecute the Chriſtians, till the Martyrs blood calling for vengeance in the fifth Seal, under the ſixth, the change under <hi>Conſtantine</hi> comes, the ſeventh bringing forth thoſe Plagues, which the ſeven Trumpets, and ſeven Vials, out of the laſt of them, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Till, the Seat of the Empire being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and <hi>Rome</hi> ſacked once and again, Chriſt appears again, to puniſh the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and falſe Prophets that ſet them upon it, to do the Chriſtians juſtice, and give them the Empire. And this is that appearance which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, to whom God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing the fortune of his Church by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, ſhews the end of the Perſecution, not
<pb n="CLXXVII" facs="tcp:115786:265"/> the continuance of Chriſtianity, a thouſand years after and more, which S. <hi>John</hi> hereby learns. And this interpretation ſo much more reaſonable, as it is more unreaſonable, that all this ſhould be ſent to the ſeven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, telling them, that they ſhould be happy in reading and underſtanding, and keeping it, which, for the moſt part concerned no ſoul in them, then, that he ſhould ſend them this encouragement, to ſtick to their Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, in the midſt of thoſe Perſecutions, which here he fortels.</p>
